In order to obviate some objections, which, I foresee, both well-meaning and ill-designing persons may be ready to offer to this part of my proposal, let me observe to them, that this association will not be attended with those difficulties and embarrassments, which their imaginations or their artifice may possibly suggest. We may presume, that our commissioners would
have the outlines of the proposed league ready sketched out, from the most approved general regulations of the acts of trade and navigation, which now relate to the colonies collectively and taking in such other conditions as should be evidently calculated for the mutual benefit of Great Britain and North America; one as the planting, the other as the manufacturing country; one as the client, the other as the patron. This general league might be very concise, compared with national treaties in common; it might be extremely perspicuous, and so clearly established on principles of equity and common advantage to leave the American deputies without a pretence, or a desire to propose any but flight alterations, and without a possibility of not acceding to it with the utmost readiness and satisfaction; and it is still less likely, there should be any insuperable difficulties started by them, when they should come to enter into their respective separate treaties.
   How the trade of a colony can be limited, and its manufactures restricted by the mother-country, on the principles of justice, except with its own free consent, I confess I have not eyes to discover. If it can be made appear, that the British parliament hath a right to say to an American, "you shall not make
a hat to cover your head, nor a shoe to defend your foot; you shall not manufacture a piece of cloth to keep out the cold, nor a knife wherewithal to cut your victuals;" why, I pray, may it not likewise say, "give us the money out of your pocket?" To obtain a little money, may be thought, and by Mr. Grenville and his disciples was thought, as convenient to the state, as the employment of our manufacturers. Observing, that not only the unreasoning multitude, but the members in both houses of parliament, minority as well as majority, not even excepting the honest opposers of American taxation, all seemed to agree, that Great Britain hath a right to bind the colonies by her regulations and restrictions in and upon their trade, navigation and manufactures; I, for a long time, suffered my own reason to be borne down, and my feelings suppressed by the weight of such respectable, though not
infallible authority; but, the self-evident fallaciousness of this proposition for ever recurring upon me, and striking my mind with redoubled force very time I considered it, I was at last obliged to yield to the force of an irresistible internal conviction, and to reject that doctrine as erroneous, and as a national
prejudice, arising from precedents, established by the mother-country, when her children were helpless new-born babes, and carefully instilled into their minds while growing up, as among the sacred precepts of filial piety; from the self-flattering and self-interested suggestions of British minds; and from
the general acknowledgment of the Americans themselves.
   But why, I want to know, are the colonies to be held for ever in the situation of cities besieged? Why is the mother-country to be the sole judge of such restrictions as may be consistent with the original intention of settling colonies; seeing that this original intention was not, in some cases, the intention of the legislature, but the intention of the emigrants themselves, when they fled from persecution, misery, and want, to take shelter in the more friendly wilds of America? Why are the selfish and arbitrary terms prescribed by one party, to be implicitly received by the other, in a commercial affair of mutual concern, and professed by the dictating party, to be for their mutual advantage? Voluntary consent and agreement, independent bargain and contract, are in the very essence of all equitable dealings in trade. I presume the Americans may be as good judges, as the people who ridiculously assume the right of judging for them, what it is their advantage to restrict themselves
to in manufactures and trade; and will be ready to take care to confine themselves to such branches, as will be most consistent with that first political maxim, of securing, at all events, the protection of Great Britain, and her valuable trade, from which they have benefits to expect, that no other European market can yield them, To acknowledge their independency, and to
form with them a friendly league, is therefore the only method, on the principles of equity, of laying them under restrictions in trade and manufactures, for the exclusive advantage of their protectors; but continuing to impose these restrictions by our own authority, and by force, as it deeply effects them in their property, by preventing money coming into their pockets, (which is very nearly allied, when done unjustly, to taking it out of
their packets without their consent) is undoubtedly tyrannical. 
   When our legislators, and others, divesting themselves of every selfish and arbitrary bias, (the characteristics of little and uncultivated minds) and guarding against all suggestions, but those of truth, justice, and benevolence, shall have duly reflected on this very important question, I flatter myself they
will perceive the wisdom of our anticipating the Americans in a candid discussion of it, and will agree with me, in sentiment, that America cannot, according to any ideas of justice or freedom, be laid under restrictions of any kind, for the purpose of strengthening and aggrandizing the state or legislature of Great Britain, except with her free will and consent, independently and voluntarily given by express stipulation and contract; and consequently, that they will see the moral as well as the political necessity, for the proposed declaration and league; and that, in fact, it remains for Great Britain to choose, whether by acting the deaf and haughty tyrant, she shall sink herself into poverty and contempt, or, by a conduct worthy herself and her boasted knowledge, and love of freedom, she shall render herself, not only the all-powerful guarantee of the independence, and monopolizer of the trade of America, but at the same time the dreaded, the dictatorial arbiter of Europe.

TO THE LEGISLATURE.
LETTER Xl
January 17, 1775
THROUGH the means of the persevering virtue of our American brethren, the heavy shades of parliamentary oppression being just in motion to retire, and the dawn of a constitutional revolution now beginning to gild the political horizon, the heart of every anxious lover of his country) and of every friend to the rights of mankind, must be greatly cheered thereat, as they will naturally flatter themselves with hopes, that the approaching day of deliberation shall bring forth healing councils and measures, sound and solid wisdom, genuine and complete justice, which could not fail to secure the lasting prosperity of Great-Britain and her affectionate offspring. It is with the molt lively sympathy in these hopes, and with the deepest gratitude to Providence for these auspicious appearances, that I advance, once more, to exhort ye to
pay due attention to the magnitude and importance of the business ye are about to enter upon ; and that ye will suffer no motives whatever to influence your sentiments or your actions, except those alone which shall arise from mature deliberation upon, and a rigid observance of your duty to your country. Unless these considerations shall have a an entire ascendency in your minds, in vain will ye attempt to act the part of wise politicians; in vain will ye
pretend to insure to these kingdoms any substantial and permanent advantages; as recent experience in American politics may amply serve to verify. And it is also because there still appears to remain on the minds of Britons a strong tincture of prejudice against a fall and compleat enjoyment of liberty by their American brethren, that take upon me once again to call up your attention to the fatal system of oppression that hath so long been the reproach of the British parliament, the false estimates that have been made of American knowledge and public spirit, together with the erroneous maxims of government that have, through a strange infatuation, been thereupon adopted, and I fear are even now relied on by some and that I also once again presume to recommend a parliamentary declaration of the independency of the American colonies, and then, that there be formed, by means of a general league, such an alliance between us as alone, in my opinion, can be effectually and durably beneficial to both countries: the nature, the practicability, the expediency and happy fruits of which league were pointed out in my letter of
the 14th of April, 1774. Although my sentiments were delivered somewhat unsystematically, and only occasionally, as ill health and other avocations afforded me leisure; and notwithstanding my arguments were accommodated to the limitations of a news-paper communication, I nevertheless produced, as I apprehend, sufficient reasons in support of the proposal I offered to your consideration. Many more of great weight and intrinsic excellence, will suggest themselves to every sensible man, who is possessed of knowledge enough to constitute him a judge of this question, provided his mind be prone to candour, and his heart to rectitude. It is true that at present I stand almost alone on this ground, and that men of the first abilities, and of the highest senatorial reputation, at the same time that they have uniformly condemned and vigorously opposed the measures of administration, have still invariably declared themselves the advocates, nay even the champions, of parliamentary sovereignty. But, so far as I have been able to learn, and I have not been negligent to gain information, they have contented themselves with declaring
without supporting their opinion. No one of them has, that I can recollect, justified it by argument; or by bringing it to the only touchstone of all pretensions to sovereignty, by shewing that it is rightly calculated to obtain,
for the people governed, the effectual security and continuance of their liberty and property: nor hath any one, that I know of, refuted my arguments for the proposed independency, or those of dean Tucker, which I have referred
to. I hope no one will be rash enough to say, that national morality and justice are not regarded by the Sovereign Judge of all nations, or that that state which seeks to aggrandize itself, at the expence of another, by craft and subtlety, by imposition and chicanery, or by any other wicked means, either deserves, or is likely to experience, any long continuance of God's favour and protection. Hath not the warning-voice of all history, from the first memorials of nations, uniformity inculcated this lesson by dreadful examples in every instance without exception, and shewn us that it is in the very laws of nature, in the
necessary constitution of things, that national integrity must in the end produce national happiness, and national turpitude, as certainly be followed by national misery? - Had we indeed no historical testimony in proof of this
doctrine, yet its truth is clearly deducible by reasoning; since there is this evident distinction to be made between the situation of nations and of individuals, men will continue to exist after death, but nations have no hereafter, and therefore God's just and wife providence seems to have
appointed them their rewards and punishments in this world. But to return, some there are who have indeed affected to treat the Idea of making the colonies independent, as too visionary and chimerical to be adopted by men practised in state affairs. - It should seem, however, from recent experience, that men practised in state affairs are not exempt, any more than those who reason on them from adopting visionary projects. But novelty doth by no means necessarily imply either fallacy or impracticability, as hath been
well exemplified in these latter ages, which have beheld various political phenomena altogether unknown before in the course of human affairs, and which were the natural effects of doctrines, whose chimerical appearance, while novel, were quite as alarming to the timid as this can be. Our union with Scotland, when first proposed, struck the majority in each division of the island with as great a panic fear of danger and ruin, as our disunion from America (if that can be called a disunion of countries on different sides of the globe that is only meant to ascertain their true relation to each other) can possibly produce in the minds of any. The crude and dreaded idea took a
full century to ripen, before it could be relished by the people. Our general experience, since the revival of earning, ought to reconcile us to the making of innovations upon all suspicious systems, wherever the suggesting principles appear, upon close examination, to be sound, just, and uncontrovertible; and it need scarcely be remarked, that it hath been by such means alone that we
have hitherto so successfully combated ignorance, superstition, tyranny and persecution, together with innumerable errors, in the whole circle of science, and that we must keep in the same path if we propose to make any farther
progress. But how, indeed, can any improvements be made, except by adopting and acting upon new ideas, as they arise on a contemplation of new circumstances and contingencies? Provided the British legislature had not first
inconsiderately, and afterwards perversely, trespassed on the lights of the colonies, slighted their just complaints, despised their remonstrances, and, by a long and wanton, series of injuries, insults, and oppressions, rouzed their
friends, and obliged them to take the trouble of thinking, it is probable that the idea of their having a right to independency might have lain dormant, in the unexplored repositories of truth, for ages to come. lf therefore they have prematurely brought on new contingencies, they must not be offended with, nor inattentive to, new ideas. Having myself the highest respect for the shining talents, the knowledge and principles of some great men from whom I differ, both with regard to the right, and to the expediency also, of asserting our parliamentary sovereignty over the North-American states, I wish most earnestly they may enter on a full discussion of those questions, either before the public, or in parliament; since I promise myself, they will ingenuously follow whithersoever truth and  justice shall lead them; either to their own conviction, or to mine; who am prepared to abandon my own opinion, the moment I can discover it to be no longer tenable without disingenuousness or prevarication: but I am principally moved to this wish, through a strong per-
suasion that the .suture prosperity of this, and the numerous nations of North America, (consequently the happiness of millions of our fellow creatures) may in a great measure depend on the opinions, upon the two points in question,
of a very few leading men, who, at this crisis, have voices in the British parliament. My voice, had I the honour of a seat, should most assuredly be heard to move for the independency of America.
   It is well known, and severely felt by us at this day, that the revolution, to which we owe our salvation from crown prerogative, from popery and despotism, glorious and providential as it was, had still its imperfections; and
that these remain to be reformed, or they will one day inevitably overwhelm the liberties, extinguish the last spark of virtue, and put a fatal period to the felicities of Britain. If ill consequences of such extent, could flow from beginnings so minute, as to be overlooked on that day of reformation, when national reflection and wisdom were displayed in so uncommon a degree; ought we not to be on our guard, while in the act of settling the constitution of
the American states upon a durable basis; and fixing a standard, a Magna Charta, to which the people of those states may at all times appeal, in defence of their rights and liberties; that we look not only to the securing of the
corner-stones and main buttresses, but take care also to cement the o:her, though inferior yet necessary, parts so closely together, as to prevent their being again shaken by the abuse of power ; or sapped by the insinuations of corruption, that grand specific for the dissolution of those fortresses of freedom, which mock all other attacks.  And allow me to remind ye, that at the period of the revolution, the dreadful state of the kingdom, when the government was dissolved, and all men impatient of a settlement for fear of an anarchy; when contending princes were striving for the throne, and all the powerful states of Europe ready to take their advantages, such a conjuncture
afforded excuses for much greater oversights than at this time, when we have leisure to keep our usual holidays, and are so much at our ease as to require diversions and all sorts of pleasurable amusements to fill up the vacuities of life, allowances can be made for. That man therefore who, on this solemn occasion, shall not pay the most sacred regard to the rights and liberties of his American brethren and their posterity, be his posessions, and even his actions, in other respects what they may, must be a very sorry pretender to patriotism. The true patriot will be as strenuous an opposer of national and parliamentary, as of regal tyranny: he will not attempt to remove the mote from the ministerial eye, before he have first plucked out the beam from his own. Consider, then, what in fact we are doing, and whither the unavoidable consequences will lead us, when we assert our parliamentary sovereignty.
If it cannot open to us the purses of the Americans, at the discretion of the British commons,  --  which heaven of its mercy to ourselves forbid!  --  what end is it to answer?

LETTER XII
January 18, 1775
"IT is," we are told, "to enable us to regulate the trade of the Americans, to restrict their navigation and manufactures, to bind them, and to exercise over
them every power whatever, except that of taking their money out of their pockets without their consent." But whence, I trow, do we derive any just authority for all these enormous pretensions? Not, I am persuaded, from
any part of that implied compact between governors and the governed, which, in reasoning upon just government, we must ever suppose and argue from, because the law of nature hath laid us under an eternal obligation so to do.
This compact, which none but tyrants will disclaim as a true criterion, evidently proves that, not only in taxation, but in making the laws by which every other part of the government is regulated, it is necessary the people do partake, either personally or by their representatives; otherwise, more or less, they will be slaves: and surely it is not in England, the very treading on whose happy soil changes a galley slave into a free man, that we shall inculcate doctrines, and enact laws to fix a real slavery in any degree on our kindred!  In the whole compass of argumentation, which hath of late been taken with regard to the respective rights of Britain and of British America, I am bold
to affirm, that no demonstration of the aforesaid rights, claimed by parliament, hath been given; and I must needs think that no demonstration of them can be given; but reasons sufficient have appeared to convince honest and thinking men, who are at all acquainted with the law of nature, and the spirit of our inestimable constitution, that such claims on our part are manifestly contrary to the rules of justice and the principles of freedom ; while those who have made history and human nature their study, will see as clearly that their direct tendency is to defeat the very ends, for the proposed attainment of which it is pretended they are urged. Who can conceive that a power so very loosely defined, so extremely extensive, and without a counterpoise; one which (notwithstanding the laboured distinctions vainly attempted) cannot but make very free with the pockets of the Americans, though not perhaps in the open and undisguised form of taxation, and in
which not one of the people, not one of the representatives of the people is to participate; a power which is to be lodged in the hands of a body of men residing beyond the ocean, having already more business at home than they
can or will execute to the satisfaction of their own countrymen? Who, I say, can conceive that such power in such hands can possibly, in the nature of things, be well administered, even in the most ordinary Instances? They
who can believe any thing so incredible, ought not hastily to pronounce plans they do not comprehend, or rather will not take the trouble to consider, to be visionary and ehimerical. To me it appears self-evident, that the exercise of such a power, how temperately, how cautiously soever, instead of extinguishing the resentments, and gaining the confidence of the Americans, must necessarily preserve alive their utmost jealousy and distrust; to produce with a moral certainty in their due time and regular order, complaint, dispute, opposition, and resistance; terminating finally, and probably at no great distance of time in defiance and contempt; all which fatal chain of consequences may be wholly prevented, as I have elsewhere shewn more at large, provided we will act justly, by anticipating their natural wishes, and aspirings after independency, with a desire of which they were inspired by
their Creator when he constituted them rational creatures and free agents; not to observe their feeling themselves to be, in their collective capacities, powerful nations, having within themselves the rights and actual powers of
a compleat legislation. He who perceives no signs of conviction in the countenances of those to whom he addresses himself, is apt to suppose he hath left untouched those particular arguments, on which the success of .his
discourse is principally to turn; when sometimes the fault is on the side of the auditors, whose passions and prejudices block up all the avenues to the judgment-seat of reason in the head, and the throne of truth in the heart,
so that even demonstrations and self-evident moral truths shall only enter at one ear, and go out at the other. So might I perhaps hope to convince, by continuing to write, did I not reflect that provided I have truth on my side.
I have already written enough; it now only remaining with my readers to convince themselves, by setting aside their passions and prejudices (particularly their lust of dominion, and their unjust, not to say unwise, selfishness) and by conscientiously appealing to their own understandings and hearts. There, if they will thus apply, I am persuaded they will find, to their great benefit and satisfaction, all the truths and motives to action, which are
necessary to give success to the cause I have humbly endeavoured to plead. I pretend not to force, but should be happy to win their assent; They must be willing converts; they must wish to be of my opinion; and bring their own love of truth, justice and freedom to my aid, or I shall certainly fail to be instrumental in removing their objections. I will therefore take leave of my subject, with a recapitulation only of the principal doctrines which, in the course of these letters, are advanced of argued from these then are amongst my positions:
1st, That the people of British America cannot lawfully be taxed, in any shape whatsoever, except in their own assemblies.
2dly, That a duty laid upon any article of our exports to them, and made payable before exportation, except they be at liberty to purchase the same article elsewhere, is a tax; and being not given and granted in their own.
assemblies but imposed by parliament, it is illegal.
3dly, That it is either a Weak or wicked conduct in those, who lay any stress on the ridiculous distinction, where there is no difference between internal and external taxes; since taxes are taxes, and all that is necessary to know is, whether they be legal or illegal.
4thly, That a parliamentary prohibition to manufacture their own iron and other commodities, together with an obligation to take them wrought from Great-Britain, and her only, at a greater charge than that at which they could
supply themselves by their own manufacture, is a tax, and therefore illegal.
5thly, That every parliamentary limitation of their trade and navigation, which operates to their disadvantage in a pecuniary sense is so much in the nature, although it may not come within the precise definition of a tax, that, (being an imposition) it is evidently illegal. 
6thly, That neither grants nor charters, precedents nor statutes; no, nor even the voluntary contract, the express act and engagement of the first planters of a distant, colony, can in the smallest degree impeach the rights of freedom in their descendants, whenever independency shall be their choice.
7thly, That it is a mistaken notion, that planting colonies and extending of empire are necessarily one and the same thing.
8thly, That it is in the very essence of liberty, that every state hath a right to choose its own governors.
9thly, That all pretensions to govern a community, so far distant from those who make these pretensions, that they cannot possibly secure to it those ends for which alone all just government is acknowledged to be instituted, are nugatory in their own nature.
10thly, That the people of America are too far distant from Great-Britain to obtain those ends by her exercising a legislative authority over them, and therefore cannot be subject to such an authority. 
11thly, That an union with America, by means of admitting an American representation in the British parliament, is the wildest of ail chimeras; as it was the basest of all insidious designs in a certain governor, to propose to administration a surprizal of them into this snare, be knowing and thinking they did not know, (vide his own Select Letters, p. 34, 40) that it would be subversive of their liberties.
12thly, That the superstitious notion of the uniform progress of empire westward only; and the absurd one, that Great-Britain must therefore one day become a province to America, are founded on superficial, empty, mistaken, and contradictory observations, utterly void of truth, with regard to the past, and equally destitute of probability, with respect to the future.
13thly, That if we would reap any lasting commercial advantages from, and preserve any durable power over, the American states, it must be by withdrawing not asserting our claims to parliamentary sovereignty;
thereby finally removing every cause of jealousy towards us, and proving that, with regard to them, Great-Britain is not a conquering, but a commercial state; not an oppressive ruler, but an equal trader; not a designer upon, but an undoubted protector os their rights and liberties against all invaders: bound to her by the ties of blood and mutual interests, by fincere love and friendship,
which abhors dependance; by the influences of one common language, law, and religion; by the same manners, fashions and habits, and by every other cementing principle which hath power to take hold of the human heart. 
14thly, That by making them independent of our will and pleasure, we (hall render them effectually dependent upon our Influence, and subservient to our interest and glory; this free country thus resembling its own kings, who always may, whenever they please, be more powerful, glorious, and happy, than the proudest of the monarchs who tyrannize over the rest of Europe.
I5thly, That it is in our power to bring into this kingdom, with their voluntary consent and agreement, every shilling the British Americans have in the world, beyond what is barely necessary for their own circulation; but that if, instead of equitable means, we will madly use no other than those of brutal force, they will speedily defy, impoverish and despise us.
16thly, That it is now, through our own rash councils and violent proceedings, too late to think of steering any middle course, of adopting measures for light
oppressions,  and being only moderately tyrannical; for that the Americans, from this day forward, must either be our independent, affectionate, and fast friends, or else the most deadly of our foes.
17thly and finally, That by means of a parliamentary declaration of their independency and a national league with them, we may, but by no other means can, effectually promote and secure, on a right basis, the mutual
prosperity of both countries.
   To this recapitulation let me only add a fervent prayer, that it may please God to endue the king and the lords of the council, the ministers of state, and all the nobility, the representatives of the people, and all in authority, with true wisdom and understanding, giving them grace to execute justice and to maintain truth; and that it may please him likewise to give unto all nations unity, peace, and concord to the end of time; but more especially to Great-Britain and British America, which have reason to esteem themselves, with pious gratitude, his peculiar people, since, through his especial savour, they
are so eminently exalted above all other nations, inasmuch as it hath pleased him, in his good Providence, to bless them with a free, a perfect constitution of government; a constitution which will improve with age, and never can know decay, so long as the people shall retain their virtue. 
P. S. The author, who wishes to attain as much self-knowledge as possible, would (without any irony) be much obliged to the Critical Reviewer of his pamphlet if he would take the trouble to prove to him what he really cannot believe on his mere ipse dixit, viz. that he is a declaimer, not a reasoner, provided the assertion be true; because he hopes he shall ever be open to conviction, and ready to accept of any one's assistance who will kindly lead him into the way of truth; an adherence to which he thinks is every man's interest. He feels a strong assurance within his own mind of being no declaimer, and though perhaps no acute reasoner, yet he thinks he is a just reasoner, or rather an appealer to reason; and he is inclined to esteem the practice of appealing as the best and most useful, because generally the most successful mode of reasoning.
