THE prosecutions commenced by the King's attorney general, against Mr. Almond, Mr. Woodfall, Mr. Miller, and some others, are of the most dangerous tendency, and threaten at once a total extinction of freedom of speech, a right coeval with the very being of our constitution. This my countrymen, is a fatal proof of the prevailing power of tyranny; from this
and some other instances, it is evident our constitution is impaired, the effect and energy of the law lessened, complaints and grievances increase, the public spirit of the community decays, corruption prevails, and the most dreadful symptoms appear that seem to foretel some great revolution, or the utter extinction of our freedom and government. Every attempt or restraint on our liberties and properties may be justly imputed to the spirit of tyranny; whether they are more secret and concealed under the covert of law, and the vile power of despotic courtiers, or more open and avowed in the manifest violations and
abuses of law and authority, trust and power. Of this sort there are several instances scarcely taken notice of, or even considered as such, because the tyranny of custom has so far prevailed as to subject the ignorant and unthinking, nay, even lawgivers themselves, to its barbarous and savage force. Therefore the maintainers of such laws and customs, whereby the blood of the innocent, and the lives of useful subjects, nay of pious and good men, of martyrs and confessors, have been and are to be sacrificed to the demon of cruelty, despotism, and state-craft, may justly be looked upon and treated as the worst kind of tyrants, whose characters and memories ought to be branded with an everlasting mark of ignominy and abhorrence.
   If those who have the administration of justice, and men in power, should endeavour to deprive their fellow subjects of that liberty which they ought to enjoy (and which is their birth-right) either by making or keeping them slaves, they must also be considered as the basest of tyrants who abuse that authority which ought to be employed for the good of the whole community. 
   All encroachments on our property, by the abuse of power, priviledge, or prerogative, and the influence of interest and wealth to maintain and defend illegal and wicked usurpations; taxation, without the due consent of the people, may be oppressive, and so may that made by the venal suffrages of evil representatives; such infringements ought carefully to be guarded against, and the very first attempts prevented by all proper and prudent method of procedure.
   When a whole nation, kingdom, or empire endures an accumulation of the evils caused by tyranny, then it appears in the greatest degree, and becomes an object of terror to the wretched subjects of it; but there are many intermediate
degrees descending from that of Asiatic despotism, to the least and lowest instances and effects of arbitrary power and every one of these has some pernicious tendency to the prejudice of the public and the common interests of mankind, and ought to be prevented by means the most effectual for that purpose.
   Those who are appointed the guardians of our lives and liberties, are under an indispensable obligation to study and provide for the common good of mankind; but if any should be so abandoned as to neglect this care and duty, and thereby suffer the natural rights of the subjects to be taken from them, either by iniquitous laws, or the powerful influence of bad ministers and
wicked favourites, they of all others are to be looked upon as the worst species of hellish tyrants, because the most grievous and lasting of all tyranny is that established by law.
   The first and principal cause of this kind of cruelty and injustice was an impious pride and a lust of power, which infatuated men with an absurd desire of exercising authority, without a regard to the right use and enjoyment of it. It
was that which actuated the heroes of antiquity and the founders of monarchies; being impelled by a blind ambition to make conquests, and
subject their fellow countrymen to the yoke of bondage; they then found it necessary to make use of all the arts of state-craft and priest-craft, as well
as arms to accomplish their infamous schemes and tyrannical designs, and to maintain that kind of legislation and taxation which was necessary for
their purpose.
   Greece, once famous for the wit and learning of its inhabitants, the numerous heroes it produced, and the illustrious exploits they performed, is
now subject to the savage Turk, who has destroyed its finest cities and introduced ignorance and barbarism into those admired seats of learning and elegance. Rome too, were the people once enjoyed their native rights and liberties, is now under the most despotic tyranny and slavery, established by law and custom, and therefore the most likely to continue.
   A true love of our country, and a due regard to its welfare, is the most effectual method to prevent the destruction of this free kingdom. This is the first foundation and real principle of all true policy, and must prevent the very possibility of tyranny and oppression, and will effectually ensure and secure to us and our posterity the enjoyment of our liberties: to this end it will be necessary to communicate every thing that may be useful to the public; yet to discuss openly the proceedings of those who are inclined to tyrannical and arbitrary government, will be regarded by them as dangerous to their designs,
and destructive of their ends and aims: and such as oppose them will be looked upon, by that party, as rebels to the state and incendiaries: but
these calumnies will never intimidate those who are fired with a true spirit of liberty. If honour and honesty was to prevail in the councils of princes and nations, we should see beneficial measures taken to remedy every evil. But instead of this, we see, in order to maintain those usurpations that have been made on our rights and liberties, an increase of taxes and impositions, to
weaken and impoverish us, and to keep an enorrnous body of hireling forces for the prevention and suppression of all efforts and attempts made for the recovery of lost liberty and laws. This being done, wherever arbitrary power prevails, neighbouring nations will think themselves obliged to provide for their own safety, by imitating the example, and thus in time all Europe, and the whole world, will be filled with mercenary soldiers, and become a field of battle.
   We see at this time martial law and discipline introduced and maintained by an avowed practice of barbarous and tyrannical cruelties, agreeable to the spirit of war and murder, but contrary to all the laws of this and every free nation. 
   State agents will fay this doctrine proceed; from a factious and seditious spirit, (but that will have no effect upon me) as the Genoese alledged against the brave Corsicans for opposing their tyranny and cruelties. The want of integrity and fortitude, as well as the baseness and corruption found in the principal officers of state and their subordinates; venal placemen, pensioners, and lawyers, together with their indolence and ignorance, their luxury and licentiousness, their party rage and poverty, all conspire and contribute to the success and establishment of arbitrary power in this kingdom. From these we can expect nothing but such extensions of prerogative, as at length must terminate in absolute monarchy, or the most fatal anarchy; preparatory to this dreadful train, a total disregard to the interests of this country now appears in
those we ought to be most of all engaged and active in promoting it; from hence follows all manner of injustice, venality and vice; (and it is now
criminal, nay capital, to exert that patriotic fortidude which is necessary to prevent oppression) the consequences of these are, our laws lose their force, and are made subservient to the ends and aims of villany, by the craft and subtelty of sophisters, and the prevailing power of interest and wealth, and at length the tendency of many laws will, be only to extend and aggrandise the
powers, privileges, and prerogatives of a few; and to weaken, impoverish, and oppress the greatest part of the community, that will in the end excite them to the most desperate and destructive enterprizes, pernicious in the event to our
governors, as well as the people, and fatal to the state and constitution. 

SATURDAY July 14, 1770
IT may not be improper nor unseasonable to describe the duty of a king, that the people of England may be able to form a proper judgment of the conduct of his present majesty, and to see how far he has, and how far he has not acted consistent with the duty of either a wise, or a good king, and leave my readers to reflect whether he deserves most, the hatred or affections of the English nation; I shall consider this as the duty of a limited, though the same is applicable to the most absolute monarch. In the first place it is absolutely necessary, that a king should have a just sense of the great obligations incumbent upon him, to promote the interest of his people, and to protect them: a king should remember that he is appointed for the good of the people, and that he is their servant; as they have intrusted him with the executive power: as they have given him large revenues to support his dignity, and to pay him homage, respect, and reverence; in all this they have certainly some view and expect some return. A king who has wrong notions of the end of his
institution, is not likely to govern conformable to that end, and consequently must govern wrong; but, let them know this, the people appoint kings that they may enjoy ease and satisfaction, which they thought could not so easily be obtained without them; when monarchs act from such motives, they are in a fair way of being both great and good, and their names will be transmitted to
posterity with honour and veneration: a prince thus influenced, will make himself acquainted with the constitution of the country he governs: if he gives himself up to, and credits the fly insinuations of ministers, the people will in time inevitably be miserable. Ministers generally find their interest in oppressing the people, misguiding their prince, and are obliged often to attempt the ruin of both to preserve themselves; some ministers have been men of honour, integrity, and honesty, under whose administration, the business of the nation has been wisely conducted; but we find when this has happened, princes themselves have been men of sense, and that they have often inspected and examined the conduct of their ministers, given them orders, and were often the chief instruments of the happiness derived from their government; but the halcyon days of those princes who were ignorant of the constitution of their country, have been few indeed, which is very easily accounted for, because they were not wise enough to distinguish, nor capable of chusing men of capacity and merit for their ministers; if would be suprizing indeed, if wicked and ignorant kings should not chuse ignorant and wicked ministers; this has been the case, and I am perswaded ever will.  --  It is a necessary part of a king's duty to be cautious in the choice of his ministers, they ought to be men of probity, men of abilities; of this he should be satisfied before they have the honour of being near his person, and has the management of affairs. When a king chuses men merely of account of their incapacity, or their being fit objects for promoting his pleasures, the nation must see in a miserable condition. Ministers should be men of known integrity, men of honour and honesty, men tenacious of their word and promises, men who have distinguished themselves by their love for their country, whose fortunes are not despicable, and whose relations and dependants are neither poor nor numerous because, when they come to finger the nation's money, they will not be able to resist the temptation of applying some to their own private use, especially when they consider it is a genteel way of cheating, not like those mean methods which endanger a man's neck: besides, by this they obtain the character of penetrating men. Great regard should be shown to the people's inclination in the choice of ministers; a good king will always use every method to please his people and gain their affections, and there is no one thing he can do that will be so agreeable to them as to chuse men who have the esteem and love of the nation. When such men are chosen whom the people dislike, the king not only draws hatred on their administration, but makes his subjects disaffected to him, discontented with his government, and prepares them for rebellion. As a king should, in the choice of a ministry, consult the humour of the people, so when he finds that ministry become disagreeable to them, he ought not to continue them;
nothing will make him more beloved by his people, nor they more ready to serve him with their lives and fortunes, than delivering up a ministry obnoxious to them; and when guilty, leave them to the resentment of an injured nation. Is it possible a prince can hesitate a moment, when it is put to
him either to loose the affections of his people, or change his ministry ; if no generous motives will influence him, he ought to consider the melancholy
consequences which have attended several princes, who obstinately and foolishly protected their ministers. A wise king will not scruple to comply
with the outcries and demands of his people, for bringing ignorant and guilty ministers to justice. The chief cause of the melancholy fate of Edward the Second, was an obstinate humour of defending his ministers; he came to the crown, though not with the unanimous, yet with the general applause of the people, and they hoped to see a continuance of his father's virtues; he  ascended the throne with advantages, which, if improved, might have made him a great and glorious monarch; but almost before the funeral obsequies of the deceased king were performed, he broke his oath, and contrary to the request of his dying father, he recalled his favourite Gaveston from banishment, and was so extravagantly fond of him, that he thought all
the honours and riches in the kingdom too little to bestow on him; and when this all-grasping minion found himself master of Edward, he then launched
out into pride, arrogance, and self-conceit; he governed the king as he pleased. (in the same manner as lord Bute hath done his present majesty) Edward at the time he went into France to celebrate his marriage, left this aspiring wretch guardian of the realm; and when he returned, continued to,
heap favours upon him; but at last, the parliament, being no longer able to brook the insults of the minister, petitioned for his banishment, which the king was obliged to consent to, though much against his inclination: however, he had hardly departed the nation, when recalled to repeat his intollerable insolence; such behaviour, licened and encouraged by the king, could not but alternate the affections of his people, and cause a general discontent: the consequence was, that the royal authority was put into the hands of certain lords appointed by parliament, and presently after Gaveston was banished a second time. If he had remained in banishment (as it is to be hoped the
minion of these times will do who voluntarily banished himself, after having divided and ruined the nation by his wicked councils and influence) Edward
by a prudent conduct, would have regained the people's affections: but he was so strangely infatuated that he recalled that arrogant wretch a second time, who repeated his villianies with mote audaciousness than ever, by which he, in a manner wrested from the people all the little remaining love and veneration they had for the king; and therefore they joined under the command of certain
lords, who seized the cause of all their grievances, and were carrying him to the king, but he was cut short by the Earl of Warwick, who ordered him to
be beheaded, which was accordingly done: however, soon after things were brought to an accommodation, a particular and general pardon was ordained, and Edward had it once more in his power to regain the love of his people; but as he meditated their undoing, so he contrived to destroy them; to effect this, he took to his bosom the two Spencers, father and Ion, who presently gained as great a power over him as Gaveston had done before; and what was still more dangerous, they, with all that wicked favourite's ambition and pride, possessed far greater natural abilities: however, after a time, the king was obliged to consent to their banishment; but getting an advantage over the barons, he recalled his minions, and by their advice shed the blood of some of the best families in England, there was not one escaped their fury, which they suspected, and they suspected all who were eminent for justice, honour, and virtue. The people notwithstanding all their grievances, who would before have assisted the king, were too much incensed against him to render him any service, they hated him on account of the obstinacy with which he defended their oppressors, whose last fate was near approaching: however, at that juncture it was impossible to destroy them without subjecting the nation to the king's revenge; it was therefore thought expedient to call a parliament, who immediately agreed to depose Edward, and to make his son king. But his misery did not end here, for after he was confined, he was used in a most cruel
manner by his keepers, who after many indignities put upon him, barbarously destroyed him, though it must be owned he brought, that on himself, by protecting his ministers, whose chief aim was to destroy the spirit of liberty, which was spread through the kingdom; and which, when it prevails, must reduce to the lowest sink, any powerful pernicious favourite or obstinate prince.
   This Gaveston found, this the Spencers experienced, and this may the present ministers meet with, is the sincere wish of him who writes this
paper; and let his majesty learn from hence, how necessary it is to give up designing ministers to the voice of his people; and that it is much more glorious for him to be influenced by the good of the public, than any private passion proceeding from favour of any particular set of men.
   They who take care of one part of the public and neglect the other, are the means of introducing a very pernicious practice in the state, tending to sedition and discord; so we see some make their court to popularity, some to power, but few desire the interest of the whole.
   Another duty incumbent on a king, is, often to examine the conduct of his servants, and to oblige them to render a just and exact account of every sum taken from the treasury, check their unnecessary expences, and punish them for any fraud: if kings would but act so, what immense sums might be saved to the nation, how many heavy and burthensome taxes might be taken off; all degrees would find the benefit of such a king's conduct, under whom miaisters
would not have it in their power to plunder the people and raise immense fortunes on the ruins of others, which is a crime of the blackest dye; the consequence is an increase of burdens on the people, and immense riches to the minions of favour, a multiplicity of officers and ministerial dependants, who rob the people and wallow in plenty, by reducing the community to want
and beggary. 
   It is above all things highly incumbent on a prince to keep his word; a false king will find himself in a miserable condition indeed; his fair promises will not avail, mankind will not trust him, beyond what they can call hirn to an account for. John might have reigned gloriously and happy, if he had had honour enough to have kept his word; he frequently promised, and as often broke his promise, by which he spent his life in troubles, broils, and vexation, and at last lost it in defending his falshood. Charles the first would never have fallen as he did, had he as he promised, acted agreeable to the principles of the constitution. His present majesty came to the crown with fair promises in his mouth of preserving the laws and liberties of the kingdom, and the event has shewn how far he has been graciously pleased to fulfill his word.

SATURDAY July 28, 1770
To the Right Honourable and virtuous Lord
NortH; Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and first Lord of the Treasury
My LORD,
THE appointment of your lordship to the Treasury, upon the resignation of his grace the duke of Grafton, was the clearest, as well as the most convincing proof of the miserable situation, to which the infamous junto of Carlton-houfe
were reduced; and reflected highly on the good sense of your royal master, our most excellent sovereign: as it is the general opinion of mankind, that the first error a prince commits is in the choice of his ministers. It seems my lord, you are determined to remain in your present, employments as long as you can abuse the confidence of your prince, or till you have involved the nation in a foreign or a domestick war, and perhaps in both: then and not till then, you will be glad to retreat; but that will be too late: for infamous as the junto is, to which you belong, and as secure as you at present think yourself in a corrupt majority in the house of commons, be assured my lord, they will not be able to protect: you from the indignation, and resentment of a greatly injured and incensed people. Nor will your sovereign infatuated as he is, and secure as
he may think himself in an army of sycophants and an army of soldiers, be able to, screen you behind the throne from the public justice you must, nay you will, deservedly fall a sacrifice with many others to your own wickedness and ambition. Consider my lord the deplorable situation, to which you and your associates have reduced this once happy and free country. But believe me, it is not in the power of men or devils to enslave the people of England. As all the attempts of Bute, Mansfield. Hallifax, Weymouth, Grafton, Hilsborough, Barnard, and your lordship, to reduce not only England, but America to a stare of vassalage, have proved abortive; let me advise you to retire in time. Consider your inability to execute (supposing you was really honest) the trust reposed in you. Consider my lord, (though you may affect not to know it) that we are upon the eve of a war with our natural and inveterate
enemies, and that all Europe will soon be little else than a field of blood. Consider my lord, nay be assured that the people will never consent to be
taxed by Luttrell, Moreton, and the rest of the ministerial pack-horses, who call themselves members of the British parliament, to support a war
brought upon them through the neglect, supineness, inattention, corruption, and wickedness of a succession of profligate, weak, and abandoned ministres, Consider my lord your great friend Jefferies, notwithstanding the many consultations he held with you and the rest of the junto, has failed in his attempt to destroy the liberty of the press, and to render useless that firm barrier of our liberties, trials by jury. This I should think would be sufficient to convince your lordship, that the people are not quite so corrupt as you and
Jefferies imagined; and that they are determined not to give up their rights as Englishmen, at the shrine of despotism; nor to be trifled out of them, through the sophistry of an arbitrary Scot: who would gladly sacrifice the liberties of England and the rest of those wretches who call themselves ministers. Amongst many other devices of this pretty state juggler Jefferies, to undermine the rights and power of juries, and to render them insignificant; he advanced, that they are only judges of fact and are not at all to consider the
law; so that if a person be indicted for a fact, which is really no crime in itself by law, but is worked up by words of form, as treasonably seditiously, &c. If the fact be but proved to be done, though there does not appear any crime,
that in compliance with the desires that shall be supplied by the law, which the jury is not to take notice of but bring in the person guilty, and leave the consideration of the case in law to the judges. Thus did Jefferies argue
(agreeable to the promise he had made your lordship) which was only an apparent trap, at once to perjure ignorant juries, and to render them so far from being of good use, to be only the tools of oppression to ruin their fellow countrymen with the greater formality. I will allow my lord, that matter of fact is the most common and proper object of a juries determination, and matter of
law that of the judges, yet as law arise out of, and is complicated with fact, it cannot but fall under the juries consideration. And in order to convince your lordship, as well as to confute Jefferies, and to make him appear the vilest traitor to this country upon record. It is by applying matter of fact and law together and from their due consideration of, and right judgment upon both, that a jury brings in a verdict. We see also in most general issues, as upon not guilty pleaded in trespass, breach of the peace, or felony, though it be matter in law, whether the party be a trespasser, a breaker of the peace, or a felon, yet the jury do not find the fact of the case by itself, leaving the law to the court, but find the party guilty, or not guilty generally; so that though they answer not to the question singly, what is law, yet they determine the law in all matters where issue is joined. It is almost every day's practice where persons are indicted for murder, the jury does not only find them guilty or not guilty, but many times upon hearing and weighing of circumstances, bring them in either guilty of the murder, or else only of the man-slaughter, by misadventure, or se defendendo, as they see cause. Now my lord as it evidently appears, that juries have, ever been vested with such power by law; so for, Jefferies and your lordship to attempt either openly to suppress, or craftily
undermine, and thereby render this great right only a formality; do ipso facto attack the government, and introduce an arbitrary power, and are both enemies and traitors to your country. For then if a person should be indicted for doing any common innocent act, if it be but disguised in the indictment which the name of treason, or some other crime, and proved by witnesses to have been done by him, the jury though satisfied in conscience, that the fact is not any such offence, as it is called, yet according to this new doctrine they have no power to judge of law, and the fact charged is fully proved, they are bound by what Jefferies lately declared find him guilty, and being so found the judge is to pronounce sentence against him, as a convicted traitor, &c. by his peers. By this means my lord, juries are made to do the drudgery, and to bear the blame or the most infamous, as well as the most unreasonable prosecution, instituted at the suit of the crown, ex officio by the attorney general, 
   Further in every indictment, information, &c there are certain words of course, called matter of form, as maliciously, seditiously, such an intentions
and these sometimes are raised by a just implication in law, but in crown prosecutions (particularly against printers, publishers, &c.) they are generally thrust in with no other view only as a pretence or colour of crime, where
there is really none. Now my lord, that no juryman may be deceived by your friend Jefferies; I will inform my fellow subjects that they ought well to consider and rightly to understand this nice distinction, where the act or naked matter of fact, is in itself a crime against law, as killing
of a man, levying of war against the king, &c. there the law does in pleading require, and will supply those words, and if the jury do find, and are satisfied, that the substance of the charge is such a crime, and the person guilty therof, they are bound to find it, though no direct proof be made of the circumstances. But where the act or matter of fact, is in itself innocent or indifferent, there the purport of these words (as that it was done maliciously, or with such or such design) is necessary to be proved, otherwise there is no crime, and consequently no sit matter for trial. In which case the grand jury is bound in conscience and law to return an ignoramus, and a petty jury not guilty.
   As it has been usual for your friend Jefferies my lord, to brow beat, intimidate, or otherwise craftily lead a jury into a verdict, I am sure I shall do an act of public justice, as well as an essential service to such of my countrymen, as may be called upon a jury; to not only inform them, but convince them that they are not finable nor no way to be punished, under pretence of going contrary to evidence, or against the judge's directions.
   I know it is often said by ignorant jurymen, if we do not find according to evidence, though we have reason to suspect the truth of what they swear, or if we do not find as the judge directs, we may come into trouble, the judge may fine us &c. I answer this is a vain fear: no judge (not even Jefferies) dare offer any such thing; you are the proper judges of the matter before, you ought to act freely, and are not bound though the court demand it, to give the reasons why you bring it in thus ox thus. It was a remarkable case before the chief justice Anderson, in the reign of queen Elizabeth; a man was arraigned for murder, the evidence was so strong that eleven of the jury agreed to find him guilty, the other obstinately refused, and kept them so long, that they were
ready to starve, and at last made them comply with him, and bring in the prisoner not guilty. The judge who had several times admonished this
juryman to join with his fellows, being much surprized at his resolution, soon after sent for him, and discoursed with him privately upon the matter; to whom, upon promise of indemnity, he at last owned, that he himself was the man that did the murder, and the prisoner was innocent, and that he was resolved, not to add perjury, and a second murder to the first. But to satisfy my countrymen and not your lordship, that a jury is no way punishable for going according to their conscience, though against seeming evidence, and the reasons why they are and ought not to be questioned for the same, I shall here recite an adjudged case, that of Bushel, in the twenty-second year of the reign of Charles the second. Reported by the learned Sir John Vaughan. The case begins folio 135, the whole well worth reading, but I shall only select certain passages. The case was this.
   Bushel, and others of a jury, having at a sessions not found Pen and Mead (two quakers) guilty of a trespass, contempt, unlawful assembly, and tumult, whereof they had been indicted, were fined 40L, each and committed till they
should pay it. Bushel brings his habeas corpus, and upon the return it appeared he was committed  --  for that contrary to law, and against full and
clear evidence openly given in court, and against the directions of the court in matter of law, they had acquitted the said W. Pen and W. Mead to the great obstruction of justice, &c. Which upon solemn argument was by the judges resolved, to be an insufficient cause of fining and committing them; and they were accordingly discharged, and afterwards brought actions for their
damages. The reasons of which judgment are reported by judge Vaughan, and amongst them he useth these that follow, which I shall give in his own words.
   Folio 140. One fault in the return is, that the jurors are not said to have acquitted the person indicted, against full and manifest evidence, corruptly, and knowing the said evidence to be full and manifest against the persons indited; for how manifest soever the evidence was, if it were not manifest to them, and that they believed it such, it was not a finable fault, nor deserving
imprisonment; upon which difference, the law of punishing jurors, for false verdicts principally depends. 
   Folio 142, I conclude therefore, that this return charging the prisoners to have acquitted P and M against full and manifest evidence first, and next without saying that they did know and believe that evidence to be full and manifest against the indicted person, is no cause of fine and imprisonment. And in the same folio he faith, the verdict of a jury, and evidence, of a witness, are very different things, in the truth and falshood of them: a witness swears, but to what he hath heard or seen generally, or more largely, to what hath fallen under his senses: but a juryman swears to what he can infer and conclude from the testimony of such witnesses, by the act and force of his understanding, to be the soft enquired after, which differs nothing in reason, though much in the punishment, from what a judge, out of various cases considered by him, infer to be the law in the question before him.
   If the meaning of these words, finding against the direction of the court, in matter of law, be that if the judge, having heard the evidence given in court (for he knows no other) shall tell the jury upon this evidence, the law is for the plaintiff, or for the defendant, and you are under the pain of fine and imprisonment to find accordingly, and the jury ought of duty so to do; then every man sees, that the jury is but a troublesome delay great charge and no use in determining, right and wrong; and therefore the trials by them may be
better abolished than continued: which were a strange new found conclusion, after a trial so celebrated for many hundred years.
   It is true if the jury were to have no other evidence for the fact, but what is deposed in court, the judge might know their evidence, and the fact from it, equally as they, and so direct what the law were in the case; though even then
the judge and jury might honestly differ in the result from the evidence, as well as two judges may, which often happens: but the evidence which the jury have of the fact, is much better otherwise than that. For, 
   First being returned of the vicinage where the cause of action ariseth, the law supposeth thence to have sufficient knowledge to try the matter in issue (and so they must) though no evidence were given on either side in court; but to this evidence the judge is a stranger. 2dly, They may have evidence from their own personal knowledge, by which they may be assured, and sometimes are, that what is deposed in court is absolutely false; but to this the judge is a stranger, and he knows no more of the fact than he hath learned in court, and perhaps by false depositions and consequently knows nothing. 3dly, The jury may know the witnesses to be stigmatized and  infamous, which may be unknown to the parties, and consequently to the court;
   Folio 148. To what end is the jury to be returned out of the vicinage where the cause of action ariseth. To what end must hundreds be of the jury, whom the law supposeth to have nearer knowledge of the fact, than those of the vicinage in general. To what end must they undergo the punishment of the villianous judgment. If, after all this, they implicity must give a verdict by the dictates and authority of another man, under pain of fines and imprisonment when sworn to do it according to the best of their own knowledge.
   I have selected these few particulars of this famous case reported by judge Vaughan, eleven out of the twelve judges being of the same opinion, and chief baron Turner gave no opinion because not at the argument. 
   As I have pointed out to your lordship so clearly the right and power of an English jury,  and as you have also lately experienced the inability of your
friend Jefferies to serve you, notwithstanding all his sophistry and abuse of law. Let me advise you to prevail upon him to resign, that he may spent the remainder of his days in penitence and tears.
