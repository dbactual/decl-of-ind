    TO CATO, CASSANDRA, AND ALL THE WRITERS ON THE INDEPENDENT CONTROVERSY
Philadelphia, March 31, 1776
GENTLEMEN:  Though it might be deemed absolutely necessary to suppress all publications which tend to disunite the Colonies in their present spirited opposition to a cruel and unnatural attack from the people of England; yet, as the question of Independency has been lately started, in a pamphlet entitled Common Sense, and supported by a variety of subsequent authors, I confess I was much pleased on the appearance of a writer on the other side of the question; for, as I have no other view than peace and happiness for myself and posterity, I was determined to give an earnest attention to the arguments on both sides. It is no matter with me whether I live under an Emperor, a Pope, a Bashaw, a King of England, or a Republick, provided I can be convinced, by irrefutable arguments, that such or such a state contained the greatest quantity of happiness for the people at large, and for individuals in particular; for, as I am in the situation of ninety-nine out of every hundred in the world, who have no expectations of ever ascending into office, and riding upon the top of the machine, and have only to expect to contribute my proportion of labour to wheel it along, I therefore think it my business, as well as my fellow-labourers, to see that it is so constructed as to move with as little labour as possible, and the machinery so contrived as to be the least liable to get out of order in the variety of rough and smooth roads through which we must inevitably pass. Now, taking it for granted that the machine must necessarily be kept in proper motion, I conclude, we are not to consult the ease and convenience of the riders, but that of the draughtsmen, who, being the majority, and giving motion to the machine for their own emolument  --  (I know, criticks, the simile won' t run upon all fours, but I shall nevertheless stick to it till you offer me a better)  --  I say, we move it along for our own emolument; and if the riders should insist on having it built to contain only a single chair for a crowned head, or to spread a larger floor over our heads to support a Commonwealth, we who pull, and not they who ride, ought to be the judges of the matter; for that some must pull, and that some will ride, in every community on the face of the earth, must be granted me; therefore, all I have to consider, with the rest of my brethren on the ground, is to attach myself to that machine, or (if you won' t let me pursue the simile) to that form of Government, which will afford me the most ease, and give me the least pain.
People in general know so little of the different movements of a State, and the complicated connections and dependencies on the other powers of the world, that they are almost unequal to the task of forming a proper judgment of the fitness or unfitness of this or that mode; for this reason it gave me great pleasure to think I was now about to have the matter laid before me in an open and candid manner, that I and the rest of my unlettered brethren might judge for ourselves. The writer signed Cato, I should have liked much better had his actions corresponded with his declarations. Had this decency really prevailed in Cato' s breast, why did he, a few lines before, charge the commentators on the conduct of the Assembly with "scurrilous misrepresentations?" Decency and scurrility can certainly have no possible connection; and, unhappily for him, in his second letter, he proceeds to term a writer, who styles himself Cassandra, "an enthusiast, a madman, and a barbarian. "Language of this kind can be of no real use to men who are searching for truth; and I will take the liberty to request Cato, in his future essays, to keep up to the decency he professed to set out with. I could have wished to have passed Cassandra unnoticed on this head; but as he also has given too much reason for censure, I will just make free to say, that his arguments have acquired no force with me by directing personal attacks on Cato, and endeavouring to point out the real man to the publick; nay, by introducing the very name of a private gentleman into his essays, and obliquely glancing at him as the writer of Cato' s letters. I am sensible it is so guarded that Cassandra may plead off, and declare, if he pleases, that he had no such person in view; and Cato might find it difficult to disprove his sincerity. Cassandra may also assert, where he hints at the danger which Cato runs of too far provoking the majesty of the people by the bold flourishes of a pen which pays no respect to truth, lest he may find it expedient to end his days on the principles of dependency," that he meant no such thing as the threatening Cato with the chance of being hanged by a mob; though his marking the word "dependency" in italicks, will certainly convey that idea to many minds. Now, gentlemen, with all due respect to you both, I would wish you to avoid indecency and personality. However sharp your minds may be set against each other, upon a supposition that you have got at the secret of names on both sides, I would request you to consider, that though you are both volunteers, yet you are in some measure accountable to the publick. If two advocates, pleading a cause of great importance before a learned Court and an intelligent Jury, were to make use of illiberal reflections upon each other' s characters, and rip up a long list of charges of fraudulent designs and wicked practices, would not both Court and Jury think themselves grossly insulted, and would not such advocates deserve the severest censure from the bench? Be pleased to remember, gentlemen, you are pleading at the bar of the publick, upon a cause of greater importance than ever came before any tribunal on earth  --  no less than whether it is expedient or inexpedient to make a total separation in Government between the new and the old world. Do you think, gentlemen, that a thousandth part of your readers either know, care for, or desire to know, who are the writers on this popular subject? If John a Nokes and Tom a Stiles should be fixed on as the authors in this city, and should hand forth to the publick every foible and unfavourable incident of each other' s life, of what importance, think you, would this be to those who are strangers to them both? If Kouli Khan' s gardener' s daughter had a child by the Grand Vizier' s brother, what has that to do with the Revolution in Persia? It is the matter, and not the man, that the publick are concerned with. If Lord North himself was a prisoner amongst us, and should issue forth from his confinement daily lucubrations on the subject now before us, I would give them as earnest a reading as if they flowed from the pen of a Camden or a Burke; and yet I am a zealous advocate against Great Britain in the present controversy. It is truth alone I am hunting for, and this I believe to be the case with nine-tenths of the people; therefore I beg you will behave like gentlemen to yourselves and to the publick; canvass the matter fairly, fully, and freely; and do not suppose yourselves of so much importance as to think we shall be pleased with your calling off our attention from the grand question, to the unimportant discussions of the characters or schemes of either party. I, with a great number of others, should be glad to see you enter deeply into the question on both sides. State the advantages of an Independence  --  the benefits to be derived from a new mode of Government; how it will affect individuals; the additional happiness and freedom it will produce  --  particularised in a number of plain, clear instances; for though I, and some others, might be satisfied with the general assertion, "that the State will be much benefited by the change," yet there is no gaining admission into some bosoms but by full and positive demonstation; and the number of such is very great. To make myself, better understood, I mean thus: If A, being a shopkeeper in this city, having a tolerable stand for business, though at a distance from the market, was to be advised by B to remove his shop to the outskirts of the town, where he should be sure to make his fortune, A would naturally require of B some proof of its probability, as the proposal might seem a strange one; but if B, being in the secret, should inform him that the Corporation had determined to remove the market to that very spot, A would not hesitate a moment about the matter. So with respect to Independence: some people will be satisfied with nothing short of such clear and demonstrative evidence. You must tell them, also, of the particular new trades which will be opened to us; the prices our goods will bear at home to the farmer, and what they will bring at such and such ports, and how much those prices exceed what we have been used to get for them at the markets we were allowed to trade to. In this you must name the articles, the prices, and the places. You must then tell us the advantages of buying linens, woollens, cottons, silks, and hardware in France, Spain, and Portugal, and other counties in Europe, and how much cheaper they are than in England and Ireland. In this, too, you must name the goods, the places, and prices; and whether these places will take in exchange our lumber, our naval stores, our tobacco, flaxseed, &c., &c., and what prices they will give; what credit it is customary for those several places to allow to foreigners on what we commonly call dry goods  --  for our country people generally requiring credit, the merchant-importer must have credit too, otherwise trade will be confined to a few rich houses, who will exact what prices they please upon the farmer and consumer. Next, you must show that the charge of supporting Government will be less, in a state of Independence, than it hath been heretofore, during a connection; you must name the expenses we now pay, and the expenses we shall then pay; you must give an estimate of the charge of supporting such an Army and Navy in time of peace, as may always preserve the peace. There are many who will not be satisfied with your telling them that "a well-regulated Militia will save all the expense arising on the score of an Army;" say they, a man' s time and labour, when he musters, will always be the same to him as money paid, and that, therefore, you must fix the number of men that are to be enrolled every year, and the number of times they shall appear; for instance, if in Pennsylvania twenty-five thousand should muster eight times in the year, at two shillings and six pence per day, it would amount to twenty-five thousand pounds, which would be just equal to the present one shilling and six pence tax on all the estates in the Province; if they are to receive no pay, it will nevertheless be a loss to them equal to that sum; if they are to be paid, the amount of this tax should certainly be estimated, because it must be paid by the community at large in every Province, in proportion to the numbers so enrolled as a Militia. The expense of building a sufficient fleet should also be ascertained, and also the number of ships and men necessary to be kept in constant pay, as guarda costas, occasional convoys or despatch vessels, conveying Ambassadors to the different ports in Europe; and you must also estimate the annual expense of watching and keeping those vessels in repair which are laid up. Also, the expenses of maintaining in every Court of Europe Ambassadors, Consuls, Messengers, Spies, and even bribe-money, for intelligence of the designs of their respective Cabinets. Also, the expenses of the Fleet and Army in time of war: for we may reasonably expect to share the fate of other nations, and of being sometimes unfortunately engaged in war with some troublesome ambitious Prince or other. Perhaps they may undertake to stop our trade up the Straits, in the Mediterranean, or up the North Seas, to Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Russia: we must then either give it up, or fight for it, or pay some subsidy to a foreign power for protection in those seas  --  the expenses in any, or all of these cases, you should give to us. Also, in what proportion the value of our estates in America will increase, so as to defray the necessary charges of Government, taking for granted that a one shilling and six pence tax in the pound on all taxable estates in America does now yield five hundred and thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three dollars  --  being rather more than half a million; which is calculated thus: Pennsylvania is rated by the Congress to pay about one-eighth of all the expenses of the United Colonies; and as a tax of one shilling and six pence in the pound in the said Province, nets about twenty-five thousand pounds, we may suppose a one shilling and six pence tax upon the United Colonies will yield just eight times as much; which is two hundred thousand pounds, our currency, or five hundred and thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three dollars per annum. Lastly, you are to consider, after all things are candidly stated, whether the sums annually raised on the one hand to protect ourselves, and the absolute gain in trade (over and above what we used to make) on the other hand, do or do not render it most for our interest to separate from Britain.
On the part of those who contend for a reunion, they must show what are the advantages that result from such a connection; what were the customary expenses of Government in America before the present rupture; what are the exclusive privileges we derive from exporting goods to Great Britain; whether there are acts of Parliament in favour of the Colonies, to the prejudice of other nations, and which we reap the sole advantage of, and whether these are equivalent to any loss we may sustain by having our trade confined to them; whether our trade is not limited to our great disadvantage. You are to particularize the ports we may trade to under the old regulations, and the different articles of America which we may carry directly to foreign ports. You must also show that the principle part of the goods we import                              from England and Ireland could not be supplied us upon as good terms from any other country; and that those nations with whom we might incline to trade, would not grant us bounties upon naval stores and sundry other articles, in the same manner as England does; the amount of which, annually paid to the Colonies, you should sum up. You must also show cause, if you can, why America ought not to take credit to herself for all the taxes paid by the English manufacturers before they send their goods to the Colonies, it being generally granted that the consumer ultimately pays all charges. You must also show whether taxes on goods imported into America from Holland, France, or Spain, where imposts are very heavy, are or are not added to the cost of the said goods, in the same manner as we reckon them on English goods. Also, whether the long established credit our American merchants have obtained in England, in the interior part of the kingdom, with the original manufacturers, cannot be as well accomplished in the new countries we may go to; or whether we must take their goods from merchants at the several out-ports, with all the middle men' s or intervening dealers' profit added to them. And if we should obtain credit at such places for twelve months, as in England, what will be the advance which a Frenchman, a Dutchman, or a Spaniard, will choose to put on his goods, as an equivalent for the risk which he will suppose himself to run by trusting strangers. Whether it is not a generally established custom with all trading nations to trust foreigners, with whom they have no legal or political constitutional connection, as freely as their own subjects in distant parts of the world. If this is not generally the case, you should show why America cannot make treaties with such powers in order to obtain credit, either by pledging to them the estates of the community at large, to make good deficiencies that might happen by individuals failing or neglecting to pay such foreign debts, or by such other means as the American States might think fit to offer. You should also show whether the low price of goods for many years past, was owing to the smallness of the demand, or to the great quantity brought to market, or to the reasonableness and moderation of the importing merchants; and whether if France, Spain, and Holland, should refuse to give credit to every young merchant going out for a cargo, with a tolerable recommendation, as the traders in England have been accustomed to do  --  I say, if this should be the case, and the importations should fall wholly into the hands of a few rich merchants, why might not some mode of restriction be entered into for preventing the exorbitant exactions they might be guilty of, to the great injury of the consumers. You must also convince the farmer, if he bought his goods as low as formerly, occasioned by a reunion with Great Britain, that he would also have the same advantages of shipping off his produce, which he has been used to, without any restriction being laid on our trade that might lower the price when he brought his crops to market. You must also point out what advantage it would be to England to have tobacco once more exported to them; and whether this, among other considerations, would be any inducement for them to offer us better terms. Some might possibly think that, nationally speaking, the being deprived of an expensive luxury would be rather a gain than a loss; for though the tax on this article may be rated at four hundred thousand pounds per annum, yet it is wholly paid by themselves, as well as the nett cost of the tobacco. The publick funds would, indeed, be losers, but the people would be gainers in a sum just equal to the nett amount paid to the American planter; therefore you must show other reasons why England would give up any points for the sake of reconciliation. And before this point is settled, you must convince us that the people of England are not gainers by our withholding trade to the West-Indies; for as the large quantities of rum and sugar, which we formerly imported from the Islands, will now be sent to England, the price to the consumer there will be considerably abated; of course the quantity used by the lower class of people will be increased; and as those articles pay very high duties, the revenue will be capitally enlarged. And it may be supposed to have this further effect: the great tracts of ground hitherto occupied in England for raising grain, purely to distil spirits, will, in a great measure, be deprived of their object, by the plenty of rum carried in from the West-Indies; and as a total stop is put to the exportation of tea, it may probably fall so low in England as (together with the low price of sugar) to make it a very general diet, morning and night, for the lower class of people; thus drinking foreign spirit, and making part of their meal of foreign produce, the land which was before employed in those services may be spared for raising provisions to ship to the West-Indies, where they will be sure to come to a good market as long as we withhold our trade thither. Therefore you must show some substantial reason for your opinion, that it is the interest of England to wish our trade with the West-Indies restored to its old state; for if England can now buy her sugar and rum cheaper, and sell her grain higher than formerly, why should she wish to reunite with us on this score? A full reply to this suggestion is expected.
You must also prove that England, on a reunion, would grant us such a protection as would secure our property in any part of the world; and that, on our complaining to their Court of seizures or detainer of our vessels by the Russians, Normans, Swedes, Danes, Hamburghers, Dutch, French, Portuguese, Spaniards, the States of Medina, Tuscany, Venice, Rome, Geneva, Courland, Grecian, Turkish, or Piratical States, &c., &c., that they would demand instant satisfaction and restitution for us, as is usual with their own ships, and all this without bringing us in for any share of the expenses. Business of this kind took up a great deal of the attention of the Commonwealth of England, their vessels being frequently detained and insulted; but, by the spirited conduct of the Protector, justice was always obtained. It is therefore your part to show that, on a reunion, the King of Great Britain would take as ample care of the Americans, in such cases, as Cromwell did of British property. Or if a reunion should not take place, you are to point out sufficient reasons to justify you in the supposition that America has not or may not have a naval power competent to the task of doing herself justice. You must also show, in case of a reunion, that England would not call on us for a share of the expenses attending a compact with Russia or other European Princes, in order to keep up the balance of the Protestant power against the Roman Catholick States, thereby preventing Popery from overrunning the world. And you must, lastly, show that, by a reconciliation on constitutional principles, we shall return to the free, money-getting trade we formerly enjoyed; and that we shall have it enlarged to us upon a grand national scale, without any regard to the private emolument of this or that party, but upon principles of the general interest of the whole Empire, without our paying any taxes for the support of Government, more than what we have been used to  --  the debt arising from the present dispute only excepted. That the administration of justice, and security of property, will be as upright and safe as heretofore; and that the present happiness and future liberty of America would be as well maintained in a reunion as by a separation.
These are heads which I would wish to see separately and largely discussed. And I entreat you, gentlemen, to pursue the subject with calmness and temper. Stick to the matter and neglect the man. It imports not who is the writer, but all are eventually concerned in the cause. I shall read your controversy with great attention, and so will thousands beside me; and if, upon an impartial hearing, it shall appear to be for the real interest of America to cut the Gordian-knot, and establish Independence, I declare, with the utmost sincerity and solemnity, that I will give it my hearty concurrence.
Should curiosity, agreeable to the fashion of the times, tempt some readers to desire a knowledge of the writer of this essay, they may be informed that his fortune, his connexions, and everything he holds dear, give him a deep interest in the happiness of America; that his abilities to serve his country rise no higher than to occupy the station of an honest man and quiet citizen; and, most happily for him, he has never been prompted by ambition to quit his post, being simply and truly A COMMON MAN.
