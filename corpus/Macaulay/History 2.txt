Several letters of Sir Samuel Bernardiston to Sir Philip Skippon, expressive of joy for the duke of Monmouth's return to court, the affectionate reception he had met with from the king, and the visible mortification of the duke of
York's party on this circumstance, &c. either by treachery, or by being stopt at the post-office, fell into the hands of the ministers. Sir Samuel Bernardiston was very obnoxious, because he had been the foreman of that jury who had rejected the bill against lord Shaftesbury; and the court took this opportunity to ruin him: he was proceeded against, by information, in which he was set forth as a man of a turbulent and unquiet spirit; and the letters were said to be written in order to scandalize and villify the evidence, of the late conspiracy. The chief justice, instead of confining himself to the trespass before the court, discharged a volley of virulent invective against the defendant: though he pretended, he said, to gild over his practices with a, zeal for the Protestant religion, his inside was rotten, he was factious and seditious at the bottom, and full of malice against the king, the government, the church and state, and against every man who had not a share in the late bloody conspiracy. His letters were as factious and seditious as could have been written, and, in his opinion, bordered on high treason: they contained the same language that had given rise to the late rebellion, which ended in the destruction of the best of
kings, and the best of governments. With these inflammatory expressions the matter was left to the jury, who were all men of the right stamp; and who, without going out of court, found the defendant guilty : he was sentenced to pay a fine of ten thousand pounds, and to give security for his good behaviour during life.
   Titus Oates, with all his vices, had some principles of honesty in his composition, of which the greater part of the witnesses in the popish plot had been found totally defective. Instead of ranging himself on the side of the court, as an evidence against those by whose power and influence he, from motives of policy, or a misguided zeal, had received favour and protection, he had never deserted any individual of the party, in the hour of distress and oppression; and with the same daring spirit with which he had accused the leaders of the popish faction, not excepting even, his royal highness the duke, he appeared in court as art evidence in favour of the persecuted exclusionists. For the part he had acted on College's trial he had been turned out of his apartments at Whitehall, forbid the council chamber, and his pension had been considerably reduced; but now that the omnipotence of the court was thoroughly established, on the accusation that be had uttered several insolent
and menacing speeches against his royal highness, he was found guilty, and sentenced to pay a fine of no. smaller a sum than one hundred thousand pounds; a sentence which, in his case, was a much severer verdict than perpetual imprisonment. John Dutton Colt, a gentleman of some fortune,
for the like offence was sentenced to the same punishment. A publication also of Johnson, the late chaplain to the lord Russel, entitled, Julian the Apostate, tending to prove that the doctrine of non-resistance was neither practised nor
taught by the primitive christians, was found to be scandalous and seditious; the author was fined five hundred marks, and to suffer imprisonment till it was paid: and the printer of the paper set forth to the public as the last speech of lord Russel, was alone preserved from a similar punishment, by flinging himself on the mercy of the court.
   Baillie of Terviswood, whose manly generous conduct, on the illegal seizure of Kirkton, has been already related, was seized in England, on the accusation of having been engaged in the plot; and when brought before the council, and offered his life if he would consent to turn evidence, he replied with a firmness equal to the august carriage of the Roman Regulus, "they who can make such a
proposal to me, know neither me nor my country." This answer, and the philosophic coolness with which Baillie treated some very severe threatnings from the king and the duke, were matters of such provocation, that Baillie was
loaded with very heavy irons, and sent down to Scotland, where tyranny had been established from the period of the Restoration, where power met with no check by any regulations of law, and where the savage custom os putting suspected persons to the torture, which had for some time been the disgrace of
every christian society, but which was now exploded in the more civilized states of Europe, yet continued to brand with barbarism Scottish manners and Scottish laws. The rule about the boots in Scotland, says Burner, is, that upon
one witness, strengthened by presumptions, the question may be given; but it was never known to be twice given, or that any other species of torture might be used at pleasure: but lord Perth, resolving to make the inquisition his pattern, was a little too early in letting the world fee what kind of government was to be expected under the influence of a prince of the Romish religion. According to this resolution, Spence, a servant of the earl of Argyle, was seized
in London, and sent down to Scotland, where he was required to take an oath to answer all the questions which should be put to him. On the refusal of Spence to comply with a demand, in contradiction to an express law against
obliging men to take such an oath, he was struck in the boots; and continuing firm to his resolution, he was kept from sleep eight or nine nights: this not succeeding, a third species of torture was invented. Little screws of steel were made use of, which screwed the thumbs with so exquisite a torment, as to subdue in a great measure the courage of the unhappy sufferer; yet such was his honour and fidelity, that even in this extremity he capitulated that no new questions should be put to him, and that he should not be produced as a witness against any person. By this method the ministry acquired the knowledge of Argyle's correspondents, the chief of whom was Holmes, an Englishman; in whose papers, when seized, were discovered the sum of money
which Argyle had demanded, and what he undertook to perform; on the granting his demands but none of his letters shewed that any agreement had taken place.
   The same oath which had been refused by Spence was refused with an equal degree of firmness by Carstairs, a presbyterian minister; on which his thumbs were put into the skrews, which were drawn together with such rigour, that when Jn the agonies of torture, Carstairs cried out, that he would confess, the inquisitors could not release the sufferer, and were obliged to have recourse to the smith who had formed these instruments of torture. On the confession extorted from Carstairs and Spence, the earl of Tarras, who had married the duchess of Monmouth's sister, and six or seven gentlemen of inferior quality, were apprehended; but Baillie of Jerviswood, on account of his exalted reputation, and the firmness with which he had withstood the promises and threats of the court, was the man against whom the artillery of ministerial vengeance was pointed. His strict confinement and severe treatment had thrown him into a decline, and his illness increasing daily, his wife petitioned
for leave to attend him, even on the condition of being put into irons. This request was most inhumanly denied, as also the attendance of his daughter, a child of twelve years of age; even when he was reduced to so low a state that
it was not probable he could live many weeks. Orr the examination of the earl of Tarras, who had married for his second wise, Baillie's niece, and whose resolution and firmness, instead of rising equal to his birth and fortune, had
been found much inferior to the conduct of Carstairs and Spence, an accusation was sent to Baillie, not in the form of an indictment, nor grounded on any law, but in a letter from the king, in which his majesty charged the prisoner with a conspiracy to raise a rebellion, and with the being engaged in the Rye-house plot. Of these accusations he was required to purge himself by oath, otherwise the council would hold him guilty, and proceed accordingly; it
was in vain that the prisoner pleaded, that by no law, except in a court of inquisition, a man could be required to swear against himself. A committee of council was sent to tender him the oath, and, on his refusal, she was fined six 
thousand pounds ; and ordered to lie in prison till it was paid. It was generally believed, says Burner, that this was a final sentence, and that the matter was now at an end; but the duke was not satisfied: Baillie was still kept under
close confinement, and denied all attendance and assistance; and the ministry applied their arts to Tarras, and the other prisoners, threatening them with all extremity of misery, if they would not witness treasonable matters against
Baillie. They also practised on their wives, and, frightening them, set them on their husbands; by which means they carried the point. Tarras and one Murray, of Philipshaugh, deposed, that Baillie, before he went up to London, had held discourses with them, in which he endeavoured to excite them to a rebellion. Carstairs was also prevailed on to become a witness; and the jury, according to the custom of Scotland, consisting of twelve gentlemen, one knight, and two peers, unanimously pronounced the prisoner guilty; and, lest the sudden approach of death should rescue the victim from the infernal arm of vengeance, he was executed on the same day.
   Such were the sufferings, and this the fatal end of a man, whose learning, courage, spirit, and integrity, classed him among the very few individuals whose virtues reflected lustre on their country in this disgraceful period of the
Scotch annals. His behaviour, during his severe imprisonment, says Burnet, looked like the reviving the spirit of the noblest of the old Greeks and Romans, or rather of the primitive Christians and first martyrs of those best ages of the church. He was little disturbed at the sentence of death pasted on him, or the inhuman haste with which he was hurried to execution; and, notwithstanding his feeble and reduced state, he made a speech to the people, in which he shewed, that in several particulars the witnesses had wronged him; in which he acknowledged the opinion, that it was lawful for subjects, under the oppressions at this time experienced by the English and Scotch, to endeavour to obtain relief by the way of arms; in which he asserted, that the design never went farther ; and in which he positively denied the knowledge of any design against the king's or the duke's life, or any plot to alter the government.
   Though the malice of the court seems to have been particularly pointed at Baillie of Jerviswood, yet it was not owing to any degree of moderation that more persons did not suffer an equal rigour of punishment. Sir Hugh Campbell, of Cesnock, was brought to trial, on a charge of giving rise to the battle of Both well-bridge; and when, on the want of a sufficient effrontery in the witnesses, they were brought to acknowledge that they could say nothing in particular concerning the prisoner, Campbell was acquitted by the jury,
he was still kept in prison, on the pretence that the witnesses, being re-examined before the council, had adhered to their first depositions. The laws of Scotland, according to Burner, treat false witnesses as felons; but the government were determined not to discourage a practice, of which their
present power enabled them to take full advantage. To this bare-faced defiance of law and justice an instance of cruelty, attended with the most melancholy consequences, was exhibited In the Scotch privy-council. Gordon, of Earlston, had been seized at Newcastle, and several letters from the Cargillites to their friends in Holland having been found upon him, he was condemned to die. Advice was sent up to the court at London, that, according to certain informations,  the prisoner had been entrusted with secrets of great importance; and the Lord Advocate of Scotland gave it as his opinion, that he might be put to the torture, though under sentence of death. Orders were sent down to such a purport; but on the first view of the engines of torture, the wretched victim ran instantly mad, and the government was so irritated with the disappointment, that a species of more exquisite torture was prepared for Ferguson; but although it was known that this bold adventurer had fled to Edinburgh, his good fortune preserved him from the vigilance of his pursuers, and he a second time effected his escape to Holland, the present secure sanctuary for the persecuted exclusionists. 
   In the narration of the conspiracy to levy war, I have followed the opinion of the greater number of historians, and the account delivered in the deposition of the witnesses; but a variety of circumstances induces me to believe, that
there was no more in the conspiracy than what lord Russel asserted to Burnet, the embryo of things, which, in all probability, might never have been put in execution, and which could only have received a form by the coincidence of circumstances, and from thence have derived motion and efficacy. It is plain, that the rising planned by the earl of Shaftesbury had been proposed, in a very loose manner, to a few of the popular leaders. Sidney, from a dislike to Shaftesbury's conduct and character, had not had any conversation, or been in the company of this nobleman, for the space of two years; and, according to lord Howard's rambling narrative, the duke of Monmouth disowned, that the business of in insurrection had been seriously undertaken; and that it was this circumstance which provoked the earl of Shaftesbury to those invectives against the popular party, which gave rise to the appointment of that meeting at Shepherd's which proved so fatal to lord Russel. On the subject of what passed in the two consultations held at Mr. Hampden's and lord Russel's, we have only lord Howard's doubtful evidence, corroborated in one circumstance, by the letters and papers which were found on Holmes ; but it plainly appears, on the face of the evidence given by the Scots and English, and by these papers, that no final determination had taken place; that no solid principles of confidence and union subsisted between the parties; that the Scots would not believe the English were in earnest, till they saw them in the field, and that
the English could not be induced to part with their money, till they were certain it would be laid out in the public service. The government was very sensible that these circumstances were greatly inadequate to the representations which had been set forth by authority to the public; and it was
on this reason that they exerted every power of oppressive cruelty, which the fanaticism of their party, the corruption, of their defendants, and the servility of both nations afforded, to extort confessions suitable to the extravagant assertion, that nothing but the immediate interposition of heaven, by the providential fire at Newmarket, and the voluntary deposition of the profligate tool Keyling, could have saved the royalists from a general massacre, and preserved the invaluable lives of the king and the duke, on which the very being both of the church and state depended. It is indeed very plain, that all the fault with which the conspirators to levy war can be charged, was the talking instead of acting; and in regard to the conspiracy for an assassination, so pompously set forth under the sanction of royal authority, by the pen of bishop Spratt, and so wickedly mixed and confounded by the court, the lawyers, and this prelate, with the conspiracy to levy war, if there is any
ground of truth in the wild rambling conversation said to have passed between these minor conspirators, it must be acknowledged, that oppression makes sober men mad; but, if any individual has sufficient credulity to believe the following particulars, viz. that any set of men, in the full enjoyment of their senses, could propose, as a necessary prelude to the seizing the Tower, to draw together a crowd of persons of all parties, by exhibiting in public the spectacle
of playing with a golden ball; that any set of men could propose seriously, that the king and his guards should be attacked by a handful of ruffians in the common highway, should be shot by an aim taken from a steeple, or by a pocket blunderbuss in the midst of a crowded audience at a play-house; such an individual has undoubtedly a sufficient degree of faith, provided he has a sufficient degree of candour, to believe the truth of the popish plot, as de-
posed by the several witnesses, or any other the most improbable fiction that ever was attempted to be imposed on the simplicity and ignorance of mankind. The truth indeed is, that both the popish and protestant plot took their rise from that species of encouragement which, from the commencement
of Charles's reign, had been given to those pests of society, state informers; to that kind of liberty of speech which is supposed to be the birth-right of Englishmen; and to those strong provocations which inflamed the tempers both of protestants and papists, into a very unwarrantable exertion of the freedom of the tongue. It is to be observed, that the treasonable matters said to have been proposed in the several meetings of the minor conspirators, in regard to the taking 0ff the king, were confined to the witnesses themselves: and if these wretches were not in the pay of the court, to draw the party of exclusionists into this pit of destruction, the only difference which exists in the circumstances of proof between the popish plot and the Rye-house conspiracy, lies in the superior fortitude and virtue of the papists who could not be prevailed on, with the hopes of pardon or reward, to subscribe to the truth of a false accusation, or expose their brethren to the fury of the times, by betraying the follies of private conversation.
   As a necessary prelude to the injurious treatment of Sidney, a declaration, or rather an envenomed libel against the whole party of exclusionists, was set forth by the king; in which it is asserted, that a malevolent faction had long,
by a variety of means, endeavoured to undermine the government; that, when dispossessed of the magistracy of the city of London, they had endeavoured to carry their point by force of arms; first, by concerting a general rising in
England, and then in both kingdoms, in concurrence with the earl of Argyle, and other discontented Scots. After these assertions, his majesty details all the absurd and improbable things related by the witnesses to merit their pardon, and deposed but as hear-say evidence; such as the invitation of several lords to dine in the city, in order to countenance the assassination, when the news of it should arrive; a declaration said to have been prepared by Ferguson; the
resolution taken to follow the blow by a massacre of all the obnoxious magistrates of London, and ministers of state; the several projects to take off the king and the duke, after that of the Rye-house had failed. And to give this minute detail all its force on the minds of the credulous and un distinguishing croud, the guilt and scandal of these desperate projects are charged on the malecontent lords in the following words: during all this time, the principal conspirators were managing their other design for a general insurrection in both kingdoms ; the names of Goodenough, Rumbold, &c. follow in train, after the duke of Monmouth and his associates; and Ferguson is placed between the assassins on the one hand, and the English and Scottish lords and gentlemen on the other, as the hinge on which the several conspiracies turned.
   The declaration was appointed to be read twice in every parish church; and this fallacious representation intended to blacken one part of his majesty's subjects, and deceive the other, was accompanied with a new form of prayer, appointed to be read in all churches, in which were the following thanksgiving clauses, calculated to sharpen and embitter the minds of the citizens against each other, in their most solemn acts of devotion to the common Lord and Father of all men: "We yield unto thee, from the very bottom of our hearts, unfeigned thanks and praise for the late signal and wonderful deliverance of our most gracious sovereign, his royal brother, and loyal subjects of all denominations and degrees, by the fanatic rage and treachery of wicked and ungodly men, appointed as sheep to the slaughter, in a most barbarous and savage manner." The people were not less forward in taking the name of the Lord in vain than the sovereign: we are told by Echard, that these solemn
mockeries were celebrated in so extraordinary a manner, and with such mighty pomp and magnificence, that there was hardly a little parish in England, that was not at a considerable expence to testify their great joy and satisfaction. The Tories rode in triumph over the prostrate state of public liberty; it was alledged, that the discovery of the plot had decided the argument, and had shewn the necessity of passive obedience, which was equally espoused by the court, the pulpit, the bench, and the bar: and under the impulse of this general madness, the university of Oxford made a solemn decree, in which they formally condemned twenty-seven propositions, collected out of Buchanan, Bellarmine, Milton, and other writers of the first class. Among these positions, which were declared to be false, seditious, impious, heretical, blasphemous, infamous to Christian religion, and destructive of all government in church and state, are to be found the following: that all civil authority is derived from the people, that if lawful governors become tyrants, they forfeit their right of governing; that the king
of England has but a co-ordinate power with the other two estates; that birth-right or proximity of blood gives no title to rule; and that there lies no obligation on Christians to passive obedience, &c.
   The books which contained these impious propositions were ordered to be burnt in the common court of the schools: the king was presented with the decree, and being thus declared in form the absolute master of the commonwealth, commenced, without farther hesitation, the exercise of that
despotic power he had acquired over the city of London. On the 4th of October, a month after the usual time of election, Sir William Pritchard, the lord mayor, was ordered to attend, and with the two sheriffs, one of whom had been nominated by the mayor, received his majesty's commission in form, the one to continue in the city chair, and the others to act in the office of sheriffs. Treby, the recorder, was displaced, and Jennour substituted in his room; sixteen of the old aldermen, who were of the Tory faction, were deprived of the honours they had received from their fellow-citizens; and, after attending on the lord mayor on the Sunday following, in their common cloaths, to denote their servility and dependence, were made justices of the peace by one commission, and aldermen by another; together with eight others of the faction in the room of Allen, Frederic, Laurence, Clayton, Ward, Shorter, Gold, and Cornish; who were all turned out, for the never-to-be-forgiven sin of having defended, to the utmost of their legal powers, the rights and privileges of that community who had honoured them with their trust and confidence.

   When Charles was first made acquainted with the king of France's resolution to attain the possession of Luxemburgh, he told the minister Barillon, that such a step in his ally would entirely disconcert every measure which he had taken in his domestic affairs; and that all the dangers and embarrassments which he could foresee from assembling the parliament, were less than the danger to which he should expose himself by the not calling it, when it should
appear, that he had betrayed the interests of England, and sold to France the most important place in the Low Countries. It is a melancholy truth, that the depravity of human nature will ever be found to exceed the notion of the
speculist: the king's apprehensions proved to be without foundation, nor indeed could it reasonably be supposed that a party who had gone such lengths in the ruin of the constitution of their own country, would be much interested in the liberties of Europe; or take into any consideration the remoter danger which threatened the British empire from the  extravagant ambition of the French king. Barillon assured Charles, that the English would only make a three days wonder of the seizing of Luxemburgh, as they had done
before of Strasburgh. These assurances, accompanied with the offer of a million of livres, so entirely prevailed over the king's fears, that he proposed the being made arbiter of the matter in dispute, that he might have an opportunity of deciding the question in favour of the king of France's pretensions. Lewis eagerly embraced a proposal which the smallest degree of delicacy must have prevented him from moving to the king; and the Spanish court were made acquainted with his most Christian majesty's intention of making their friend and ally, the king of England, the arbiter of the matter in dispute between the two courts: but the Spaniards, with a contempt and resentment which sufficiently manifested the just idea they had formed of the
treachery of Charles, and the duplicity of both monarchs, refused their assent to the proposal, on the reason that such an assent would be the absolute surrender of Luxemburgh. This refusal of the Spaniards afforded to Charles the pretence of denying to Spain that assistance which he had stipulated by treaty to afford her; and Lewis prepared to wrest by the force of arms those advantages which he had been unable to gain in the way of negociation.
   Spain, even in this distressed and forsaken condition, scorned to submit to the injurious and ruinous pretensions of the haughty Lewis: the marquis de Grana, who had received a threatening message from the marshal d'Humieres,
the French general, signifying that his most Christian majesty having for two years together vainly expected satisfaction for his pretensions on Alost, &c. had commanded him to assemble his forces, and to take immediate possession, dispatched advices of what had happened to the princes of Ger-
many, to the king of England, and to the States of Holland, accompanied with the most lively remonstrances of the danger at hand, and the apparent necessity of an immediate assistance. In return to these advices and solicitations, the marquis received from the states of Flanders, a large benevolence; but the emperor, though equally interested with Spain, was too much engaged with the Turks to afford any assistance; the German princes had suffered too severely by the last, to enter precipitately on any new war; and the States of Holland did not care to engage in so unequal a contest.
   In this critical situation of affairs the prince of Orange, deeply affected with the injurious conduct of Lewis, and the dangers which attended his country from the encroachments of this monarch, attempted, though in vain, to figure again in the sublime character of the patron of the liberties of Europe. He assembled the States of Holland, and, in concert with the pensionary Fagel and the Spanish resident, left no expedient untried, to engage the Dutch in a new levy of sixteen thousand men; but the prince's endeavours were not
attended with success: the town of Amsterdam, in which the French faction were prevalent, with the provinces of Friezeland and Groningen, refused their assent; and the prince was so far provoked with the opposition as to infringe one of the fundamentals of the Dutch government, by insisting that a plurality of voices would, in this instance, be held of equal authority with the unanimity required by the constitution; and though this daring trespass on the rights of the minority was carried in form by a majority of votes, yet it lost to the Stadtholder all that popularity which accompanied the first period of his elevation. The town of Amsterdam, and the dissenting provinces, absolutely refused to supply their contingencies of men and money, and the town of Amsterdam carried their resentment so far as to propose the setting up the prince Casimir of Nassau, a near relation of the prince of Orange, as their stadtholder. These domestic broils, accompanied with a general apprehension, that the prince, under the pretence of war, only sought an opportunity of enlarging his authority, and the flattering assurances given by the French ambassador, that Luxemburgh, or an equivalent to the possession of this town, would put a period to his master's ambitious views, held the states so
long in suspence, that Luxemburgh was absolutely taken before any assistance was given to the Spaniards. In this situation of affairs the deputies of the States General signed a truce with the French minister, on the terms which
had been proposed by France, viz. that the French king should be left in the possession of Luxemburgh for the time of the truce; that the king of Great Britain should be arbiter, in case any disputes should arise between the contracting powers,, as also guarantee; that contributions should be
continued on both sides, till the day fixed for exchange of the ratifications; all arrears then due, to be paid within six months; all hostilities to cease; the States to withdraw their troops out of his Catholic majesty's service, in case he should not accept the truce within the time prefixed, and not to give him any assistance in the farther prosecution of the war; the most Christian king not to make any new conquests in Flanders, or to accept any equivalent there for the conquests he should make elsewhere.
