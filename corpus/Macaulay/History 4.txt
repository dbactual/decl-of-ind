   On the same Monday that the new plan of reformation was to commence, the king, who had hitherto enjoyed an almost uninterrupted state of health, and who had been careful to preserve the strength of his constitution by daily exercise, fell suddenly ill, complained of an oppression in his stomach, and had a kind of fit, which was so far relieved by bleeding, that the physicians entertained hopes of his recovery until the Thursday following, when he relapsed, and was pronounced to be in imminent danger. In this extremity he was, according to the usual form, attended by Sancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, Compton, bishop of London, and Ken, bishop of Bath and Wells.
   The dying and the unfortunate are commonly in a situation to hear truth, because it is no longer the interest of their dependants to flatter them. Compton advised him to prepare for the worst; and Sancroft gave him a long and weighty exhortation, in which it is said he used a great deal of freedom; but the hour of death, when the energy of the mind must be greatly weakened by the oppressive sickness of the body, is surely a very unfortunate period to begin the painful and laborious exercise of deep and serious reflection, and consequent reformation. The king was too sensible of the difficulty of the task to entertain one thought of undertaking it; he had always cherished a predilection for the doctrine of the church of Rome, on the authority it had assumed of forgiving sins, even in the most depraved state of the human mind; and what he was supposed to have said in jest, that the Romish religion was the only religion fit for a gentleman: he now acted in earnest, and turning a deaf-ear to the ill-timed advice of these ghostly fathers, he treated their exhortations with reserve and contempt, and continued in an obstinate silence. Barillon was the prime confidant of the duke of York, and the duchess
of Portsmouth, and did not fail in his attendance at Whitehall on this important occasion: he was sent for in a great hurry by the duchess, whilst the duke and he were conversing on the favourable prospect of affairs. Monsieur
the ambassador, fays the female favourite, I am going to tell you the greatest secret in the world, and my head would be in danger if it was known, the king of England at the bottom of his heart is a catholic; but he is surrounded with protestant bishops, and no body tells him his condition, or speaks to him of God. I cannot with decency enter the room ; besides that; the queen is almost constantly there, the duke of York thinks of his own affairs, and has too many to take the care he ought of the king's Conscience; go and tell him that I have conjured you to warn him to think of what can be done to save the king's
soul: he commands the room, and can turn out whom he will; lose no time, for if it is deferred ever so little, it will be too late. Barillon performed the part enjoined him, and the duke of York entered with great zeal into the duchess of
Portsmouth's sentiments: he found means to speak with the king, who assured him, that he never would be brought to receive the sacrament from any of the protestant bishops; and the difficulty now lay in the clearing the room of these
troublesome prelates, and the rest of the protestant attendants, and the finding out a priest who would be hardy enough to administer the sacraments to his majesty. One Hudlestone, a Scotchman, who had saved the king's life after the battle of Worcester, and who for this reason had been excepted in all the laws made against the papists, chearfully undertook the task of saving his majesty's better part, his soul: he was conducted into the anti-chamber in
disguise; it was now signified to the company, that the king desired that every body should retire except the earls of Bath and Feversham: Hudlestone was introduced into the royal bed-chamber, by the faithful Chiffins; his majesty solemnly promised to declare himself openly a papist, if he recovered his health; and, after a formal confession of his faith and his sins, received absolution, the communion, and the extreme unction. When these ceremonies were over, the king's chaplain, the bishop of Bath and Wells, was re-admitted; but, according to Barillon, either from the apprehension of a refusal, or the fear of irritating the duke of York, he was not officious on the point of pressing the king to make any profession of his faith. If we may believe the popish writers, and, in particular, Barillon, from whose letters to the king of France almost the whole of this account is taken, Charles appeared much more easy aster the confession he had made of his faith, and the receiving the sacraments of the church of Rome: he expressed himself also in terms full of tenderness, friendship, and even gratitude to the duke of York, asked his forgiveness for the vexation which any part of his past conduct might have occasioned him, recommended the duchess of Portsmouth and all his children, except the duke of Monmouth, to his care and protection; and died with a tolerable composure of mind, though in great pain of body, between the hours of eight and nine in the morning, on the sixth of February, 1685, in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and the twenty-fifth of his reign.
   The drawing the characters of those unfortunate individuals whose conduct is the proper object of satire rather than of panegyric, is the most invidious and the most distressful part of historic composition ; because descriptions
sufficiently animated to point out the opposite nature and consequences of vice and virtue to the vulgar, are contrary to the judgments and feelings of philosophy, which regards with an eye of compassion that infatuation of mind which leads men to prefer the disgrace and misery consequent to the one, to the tranquillity, happiness, and true honour which must necessarily attend the other; and because it is an undoubted fact, that it is education and circumstances which alone form the man, and which alone preserve the
innocence of the weak, and give the lustre of virtue to the splendid qualities of genius and understanding. It is an observation among the vulgar, when they wish to express a high degree of acrimony against an unfortunate sinner, that
the wretch had a sufficient understanding to have acted better; but the history of human misery very fatally shews, that a quick and enlightened understanding, as it is necessarily attended with a warm imagination and strong passions, if not guarded by a good education, and supported by virtuous habits, will always, in proportion to the strength of its abilities, deviate from the rule of right; because it will naturally pursue with more energy the objects of mistaken happiness. It is under the last of these descriptions, that we may justly class Charles the Second, on whom nature
had bestowed powers, which, if properly exerted, might have constituted an heroic character; but which, by an adverse fate, enabled him to exceed in wickedness and folly all the princes who had ever fat on the English throne.
   Among those favourable incidents which assisted to complete the good fortune of the popular Elizabeth,, the adversities of her youth, and the maturity of her age when she was advanced to the dignity of sovereign power, have been justly considered as the most advantageous; because, by the insight it gave her into the human character, it enabled her so artfully to adapt a system of selfishness, to the appearances of magnanimity, and the prejudices of the vulgar, as to reconcile a very high degree of injustice and tyranny with
that reputation which, in the eye of reason, is alone due to the benefactors of mankind : but, as in the current of human affairs, a very trifling difference, even in minute circumstances, is attended with such important consequences
as to produce an entire opposition of effects, so the unhappy fate of the first Charles, and the adversity into which it necessarily threw his son, by depriving him of the advantages of parental care, and exposing him, at a time of life when the passions are the strongest and the judgment the weakest, to the perfidious licentiousness which prevailed in the court of France, gave such a strength and power to the natural biass of his disposition, as totally to efface every vestige of that moral sense which helps to form the mixt character of the
generality of mankind, and which is seldom entirely lost, even by the most flagitious. If with the jaundiced eye of prejudice we can excuse, and even applaud the mean hypocrisy used by Charles, during his abode with the Scotch convenanters, the breach of his oaths, and the barbarity with which he afterwards treated this people, when exalted to a kind of despotic power over them, with the persecutions with which he repaid the services of the English presbyterians; what can even the voice of faction fay to the ingratitude with which he treated the ancient and faithful friends of the fortunes of his family; and the dismissing all those with ignominy who endeavoured to reconcile the prerogative of the king with the safety of the nation and the existence of the constitution? What can the voice of faction say to the palpable neglect: which this prince, in several instances, paid to his father's memory; and, in particular, in the accepting, a sum of money for the expence of his funeral, and the pocketing of it for his private use? What can the voice of faction say to the treatment of their avowed and steady patron, the earl of Clarendon ; what to the king's behaviour to the duke of Ormond, in the case of Blood, &c. and what to the indifference with which he treated the memory of a sister, whom he pretended to love with the highest degree of affection? If with the men of pleasure, and the thoughtless companions of the bottle, we view with complacency, and even with applause, the licentious manners of a prince infected with, the vices of every country which had yielded an asylum to his wandering steps, is it possible not to reflect, that Charles was totally deficient in that kind of sympathy, and indolent good-nature which often accompany the effeminacy of a luxurious life; and that the unjust severity, and even cruelty with which he treated all those whom he regarded as his enemies, are blemishes not to be excused, when united, to the severest manners and the highest rectitude of principle.
   If with the papists, we applaud the king for the pious, design he had entertained of restoring the British, empire to the church of Rome; what can we say to the easy manner, in which he abandoned this design, and the whole party, to their inveterate enemies? What can we say to the breach of the promise he had made to this body, that he would declare his conversion, and avow his patronage after the receiving a sum of money for this purpose from the court of France? And what can we say to the mean manner in which he concealed his predilection to popery till the hour of his decease, in which he vainly hoped to secure a safe passage to the regions of eternal bliss, from the merits of a submission extorted by the terrors of an affrightened conscience? And if with the zealous churchmen, we regard him as the patron of the restored privileges of that holy body, what excuse can we make for the deep designs he had entered into, of sacrificing all those sacred rights to the ambition of papists, and the interests of the papal chair?
   In the duties of private life, we are told by the panegyrists of Charles, that his conduct, though not free from exception, was in the main laudable: but though a large measure of indulgence is to be given to the foibles, the infirmities, and even the vices of every man or woman, who has not received the benefits which arise from a perfect form of education, yet we cannot possibly trespass so highly on our sense of propriety, decency, and the inestimable virtues of sobriety, as to rank that facility with which the king became the constant dupe of his amorous inclinations and passion for variety, among the good qualities of a rational agent; nor can we agree to the observation, that Charles was a civil and obliging husband, merely on the merit of his not having sacrificed an innocent woman to the venom of party spirit. On the contrary, setting aside the advantages of affluence, and the splendor of rank, the queen's situation
must be considered as equally mortifying to that in which every other female is involved, whom a severe fate unites in the indissoluble bonds of matrimony with a profligate rake. On the subject of the king's constancy to the duke of York's interest, it is observable, that a coldness and mutual jealousy prevailed between the two brothers till the period of the first French treaty; a circumstance which rendered all future dissention dangerous to the peace and happiness of both. Burnet asserts, that Charles both hated and feared his brother; and Sir John Reresby, who has manifested the highest degree of partiality to the conduct of the king, allows that it was motives of policy alone which were the grounds of his inflexible patronage: as on this single instance therefore, thus circumstanced and opposed by the whole tenor of Charles's public and private conduct, it is impossible to agree with the duke of Buckingham, that this prince was even inclined to justice ; or with the rest of his panegyrists, to found on the merits of the act of indemnity, extorted from
the necessity of the times, a propensity in his disposition to clemency and forgiveness; we must conclude, that the harsh picture drawn of Charles the Second, by bishop Burnet, is a jufl. likeness, viz. that' he had enormous vices without the tincture of any virtue to correct them; that under the appearance of gentleness, he concealed a cruel and unrelenting heart; and under the mask of sincerity, the highest degree, of hypocrisy and dissimulation; that he was void not only of every princely, but every manly sentiment; that he was as incapable of friendship as of integrity; that he considered power and the trust which accompany it, in no other light, than as the means to gratify his criminal and selfish passions; that he acted as the foe rather than the protector of his people; and that it was lewdness, indolence, and the love of ease, which were the single correctors to that rage for absolute power which infects almost all princes ; and which, but for the predominancy of less exalted passions, Charles
would have pursued with a vigilance equal to the importance of the undertaking; and which, notwithstanding the unconquerable indolence of his temper, the depravity of the times had in a great measure enabled him to effect.
   If we take a view of the turbulent reign of Charles the First, and the government of Charles the Second, it will lead us to discover, that of all moral evils, the convulsions of civil discord not excepted, there are none which bear any proportion to those which arise from the stability of power in corrupt hands; and should the largest credit be given to what has been advanced by the earl of Clarendon, in respect to the decorum preserved in the conduct of the royal martyr and his court, we shall have room to animadvert on that depravity of religious and philosophic sentiment, which necessarily accompanies the pleasures and the pomp of royalty.
   Through all the exteriors of decent deportment preserved by this prince, it must be confessed that those salutary principles of conduct which are calculated to extend the blessings of private possession to the community at large, and so strongly enforced by the precepts of the Gospel, gave way to 
that overbearing spirit of insolence which ever attends personal distinction, power, and opulence. Should the sacred writings of the New Testament be put into the hands of an individual entirely ignorant of the history of Christian monarchies, his imagination would be fired with the contemplation of a golden age returned to man: he would eagerly enquire where those societies were to be found, who, professing so pure a faith, who, enlightened with such divine instru6tions and precepts, accompanied on the one hand with
tremendous threats in case of disobedience, and splendid promises on the other in case of conformity, must necessarily act on such a plan of faultless morality, as to make men taste the blessings of an earthly paradise, before they entered into the regions of everlasting bliss. In what quarter of the globe
are those blessed societies to be found, would he say, where humility and brotherly love, where moderation and sobriety, reign; where all the heavenly virtues prevail, and where the dæmons of pride, revenge, and tyranny, the attributes of Pagan deities, give way to every species of benevolence, which tend to lessen the evils of human existence? Such a reformation in the
conduct of mankind was undoubtedly one of the important objects of Christ's mission, and the necessary consequence of a steady and uniform adherence to his doctrine and precepts, it was the balm which helped to support the primitive christians through all the terrors of a bloody persecution; but no
sooner was the cross of Christ crucified united to the imperial banners, no sooner did the lusts of power, office, and favour, display their bewitching charms to the frail senses of the followers of Christ, no sooner did the church militant triumph in the spoils of Pagan superstition, than the temporal advantages which 'ensued overcame almost instantaneously every part of that allegiance to a crucified God, which had continued firm against every form of human violence. From this unfortunate period began that contest for power
among the different sects of Christians, which stain for a long period of time the annals of the Christian history; from this unfortunate period every virtue, which, through the vale of complicated misery, had shone with a splendor sufficient to combat the prejudices of education supported by power, gave way to those fascinations which had overwhelmed the world in sorrow from the first ages of man. Priests, instead of keeping to the plain and simple meaning of the Gospel, thought proper to reconcile the most pernicious lusts of humanity with their devotion to a master, whose doctrine is founded on the principles of a rigid self-denial, accompanied, with an unbounded benevolence, and in defiance of that severe text of scripture which shuts the gates of heaven against the rich, on account of the almost necessary vices which accompany this state of temporal felicity, instead of endeavouring, even
with the Pagan philosophers, to suppress the unbounded luxuries and pride of courts, with the vain glorious pomp of the opulent: by fixing the attention of mankind on the rational pursuits of mental enjoyment, they emulated the civil magistrates in every noxious point of conduct; and whilst they were obtaining power and riches by the influence they had gained over the easy credulity of man, they assumed a spiritual authority for governing their consciences with an implicit sway.
   The period of the Reformation, though it cleansed the sanctuary of much of that carnal filth it had acquired, during the halcyon days of the church; yet it did not in this country effect any very essential reformation either in the
morals of the laity or the clergy: on the contrary, as it subjected the church to the authority of the civil magistrate, by depriving it of its independent power, religion became more than ever the engine of state policy ; the attention of
the multitude was diverted from all the moral parts of the Gospel, by fixing it on speculative points of faith; and the most noxious pretensions of royalty were solemnly authorized by the church of England : passive obedience and non-resistance were preached up as essential points of human conduct, and an implicit submission to an idol created by human power, was set forth as one of the most necessary parts of religious duty.
   The reformation of abuses is so congenial to the active spirit of man, and his perceptions of truth, that whilst any virtue remains in society untainted by the corruptions of interest, the baseness of servitude, or the enervating powers of
luxury, there will ever be found a considerable party active in the useful pursuit of correcting those errors in spiritual and civil government, to which they are necessarily subjected from human vice and infirmity. The inquisitive spirit of mankind, checked by the policy of the church of Rome, which excluded private judgment, or even examination into the meaning of the sacred writings, exerted the liberty it had gained by the system of the
reformation with a vigour which ever accompanies novelty and the use of new acquired rights; hence numerous sects arose, who were equally ambitious of restoring Christianity to its primitive purity, and particularly of re-establishing that  parity among churchmen which prevailed during the first ages of the Christian church. The success which attended these reformers was sufficient to revive all that energy in religion which the slothful, carnal, and selfish conduct of the clergy, for a long series of ages, had helped to extinguish.
When the cause of religion and virtue is supposed not only to be patronized, but assisted by the influence of divine power, there can be no bounds to the zeal of human exertion; and on these reasons, the devotion and vigour of faith
universally found in all the different sects of reformers, did not give place to the passionate spirit of religion in the first Christians, and continued till the interesting period of Cromwell's usurpation, and the consequent period of the Restoration, an event which, by turning the course of government to the
old channels, acted in direct opposition to the success which had attended the reformers in the civil wars. The seeming desertion of Providence at a time when, to the eye of the enthusiast, matters were tending to the establishment of a new Jerusalem on earth, in which the purest tenets of the Gospel were to be reduced tp general practice, gave a considerable shock to religious confidence, and enlarged the narrow limits into which scepticism had hitherto ranged to a dangerous extent; and as the spirit of devotion had proved fatal to the power of the crown and the temporalities of the clergy, due care was taken to prevent the revival of a principle so formidably active. It was in. the licentious reign of Charles the Second that writings were first publicly broached, which called in question the divine authority of Christ's mission, and all those glorious promises of the Gospel, which, if firmly believed, must in a great measure prevail over human vice and infirmity. It was in this licentious age that, those baneful systems of philosophy were revived, which, by calling in question the future existence of man, strips the Deity of the attributes of justice and goodness; destroys every benevolent end in the creation; renders it the splendid work of an ingenious and all powerful artist, devoid of every principle of true wisdom and greatness; sets loose the vicious and inordinate affections of the artful and the powerful to prey on the weak, the simple, and the injudicious; and, by adding the insupportable horror of
despair to the afflictions of the infortunate, increase the evils of human existence beyond the possibility of human bearing: hence proceeds the numerous suicides, and all those acts of violence and desperation, which help to sadden the annals of the English history.
   Opinions tending to establish the belief of a supreme governor, and which call in question those attributes on which the happiness of all created beings must necessarily depend, or the more monstrous supposition, that the virtues of the divine character are of a different nature and complexion from those which reason approves in man, lead to conclusions evidently more mischievous than atheism, because it admits a query, whether the malignant cruelty of a Nero may not be more similar to the character of the Deity, than the virtues of a Socrates. When opinions thus baneful co-operated with the example of an universal depravity in the manners of the great, .and was immediately followed by all those undermining mischiefs, which attend the successes of a government founded cm corruption, it cannot be a matter of
astonishment that die course of vice, in England, should be attended with a rapidity which, in a little more than a hundred years, has brought the nation to an acme of wickedness, which touches at the height of all that is contemptible and hateful in rational agents; it cannot be a matter of astonishment, that the deceitful appearances of pleasure, the vanities of shew and parade, with the ostentation of wealth and distinction, should exclude every idea of patriotism and public good; that the rich should despise those instructive writings in religion, morals, and politics, which inculcate the duties of moderation, forbearance, justice, charity, and universal benevolence, even at the expence of every selfish advantage; that she great body of the nation should be encouraged in every vice which tends to divert them from the pursuits of present welfare or future happiness; and that every salutary admonition should be treated with general contempt, and every eminent degree of public virtue persecuted with an unremitting rancour. It is on these reasons, that in contradiction to that great oracle of history, Mr. Hume, we cannot help thinking that the cure of fanaticism, by the prevalence of licentiousness, debauchery, and irreligion, was a very great evil rather than a benefit to the kingdom ; and that the mistaken grounds of religious and moral conduct, on which some of the fanatics acted, could never have been so destructive and universal in its consequences as the total loss of all principle, both moral and religious.
   Bishop Burnet asserts of Charles the Second, that when he saw any young men of quality of promising parts, he drew them about him, and set himself to corrupt them both in religion and morality; in which he proved so unhappily
successful, that he left England much changed at his death, from what he had found it at his restoration; and Mr. Hume  confesses, that the libertinism of the king, and the vitiated taste of his court, served rather to corrupt than to improve the science of the belles lettres: but the fatal blow which this prince gave to religion, was the blending of carnal and spiritual pursuits, by restoring the bishops to their seats in parliament. Were these fathers of the church confined to the divine object of their spiritual institution, and thus guarded from the temptations of ambition, and that general contempt which must ever follow apparent corruption in the professed servants of Christ, they would naturally attract an esteem and veneration from the multitude, which, when
united to a proper attention to the sacred and important duties of their function, would preserve order and decency through the whole body of the clergy, inspire a spirit of true religion in the laity, and preserve a happy medium between the extremes of fanaticism and a hopeless scepticism;
and an establishment in the hearts of the people, on a due sense of spiritual and moral advantage, would undoubtedly be a founder security for all the just rights of the church than the slippery foundations of a corrupt and carnal policy.
