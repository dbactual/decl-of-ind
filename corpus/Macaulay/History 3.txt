   Spain, who had been so enraged at the treatment which she had met with, as to declare war against her insolent enemy, in the hopes that the other powers of Europe, sensible of the common danger, would fly to her assistance, now
found herself obliged to submit to the conditions of a treaty, in which her interest had not been at all considered; and this with the mortifying addition of sacrificing to the vengeance of France her only faithful ally, the republic of
Genoa, who had valiantly sustained a bombardment, by a numerous French squadron, rather than submit to the conditions of asking pardon for the offence given by their attachment to the Spaniards; also to join the gallies they
had built for the service of this state with the naval force of France. The injury which the Genoese had suffered by this bombardment had been great; and now seeing themselves entirely abandoned, and left out of the treaty  concluded with the French king, they were obliged to have recourse to the pope, to interpose with his most Christian majesty in their favour, who was pleased to grant them a peace on the following, severe, unjust, and insolent terms, viz. that the doge and four members of the senate should in person
repair to France, by a certain time, and proceed to the place where the king should then reside; and being admitted to an audience in their robes of ceremony, should in the name of the republic, declare their sorrow for having displeased his majesty, and use such other expressions of respect and submission, as should demonstrate the sincere desire of the republic to deserve his majesty's kindness for the future; that the office of the doge would not be supplied during his absence; that he should resume the exercise of his
function at his return; that the republic should dismiss the Spanish forces in her service, renounce all leagues since the first of January, 1683; reduce their gallies to the fame number they were three years before; give such a sum of money as the pope should think fit, towards the reparation of the churches and monasteries damaged by the bombs, and pay ten thousand crowns to the count de Fiesque.
   There is a manner in submitting to necessary acts of humiliation which discovers an equal measure of fortitude and gallantry, as in actions where the highest degree of courage is displayed: and such was the dignified air and carriage of the first magistrate of this noble republic in this constrained act of submission, as drew the admiration of every sensible spectator, whilst it excited an equal degree of contempt for the ostentatious idol to whom the extorted homage was paid. Whilst all the dazzling glory of Versailles, says Burner, was set forth to the doge, and the flatterers of the court were extolling the magnificence of the sovereign, he seemed to look at every thing with that indifference which became a person who was at the head of a free commonwealth: and when he was asked if the things he saw were not very extraordinary, he returned the following answer. That the most extraordinary of all these things, which he had observed, was to see himself at Versailles.
   The affronts and injuries offered to the prince of Orange were almost equal to those which had been inflicted on the Genoese: the prince of Conde was prevailed on to put in a claim to his principality of Orange, situated in the midst of Provence; and the stadtholder was cited to appear before the French privy-council, by the style of William, count of Nassau, living at the Hague, in Holland. The prince of d'lsinguin was authorised to seize his lands in Brabant, Dauphine, and the duchy of Luxemburgh, his lordships in Burgundy, his customs on the Rhone, and in the principality of Holland; and to expose to public sale the counties and demesnes of Warnesson, Wiandon, Deusburgh, Badgenback, and St. Viths. The provinces of Zealand, Guelderland, Utrecht, and Holland, remonstrated against so outrageous an infraction of the treaty of Nimeguen. In this hour of distress, the prince applied to the king of Great
Britain, to use his interest with the French monarch to obtain the redress of these multiplied oppressions; but with so little success, that, instead of interceding in his behalf, both the uncle and the father-in-law co-operated in heaping mortifications upon him; and, according to bishop Burnet, Chudleigh, the English envoy, who had offered a personal affront to the prince, in contradicting the orders he had given to the British troops in the Dutch service to pay the common honours of a salute to the duke of Monmouth, joined with d'Avaux, the French minister, in widening the breach between him and the town of Amsterdam. And though the project in favour of the prince Casimir, of Nassau, was laid aside, yet the prince of Orange had the mortification to sustain a great diminution in his power and authority, by the disbanding all the additional forces which had been raised in the year 1682, to the number of fourteen hundred and forty-six horse, and nine thousand and forty-two foot.
From the period that the earl of Clarendon had been dismissed from his high office, and the king had taken the administration of the government into his own hands, the mysteries of the interior cabinet were seldom fathomed, even
by those who appeared to possess his majesty's highest confidence. The marquis of Hallifax, the ostensible minister, and Sir Francis North, the great director of the law proceedings, were so little in the secret of the French treaty,
that the marquis of Hallifax, who was no longer in any apprehension of that formidable spirit which signalized the conduct of the three last parliaments, advised his master to take advantage of the present height of his power, and the depression of the exclusionists, to get rid of the necessity of depending on France, and to render himself more considered by that court by his opposition than he had ever been able to do by his services: the faction, he said, who had carried matters so high in former parliaments, lay now gasping at his feet, the body of the people were at his devotion, and the disposition of men's minds had been so altered by the discovery of the plot, and the use which had been made of it, that he might depend on having such a majority as would make him perfectly easy in the circumstances of his finances, for the remainder of his life. Sir Francis North seconded his advice, and farther represented to his majesty, that he had given his royal word in print, that he would govern according to law; that as the law then stood, parliaments were not to be discontinued above three years; and that in falsifying his own gracious declaration, he would furnish the faction with such reasonable complaint against him as would enable them once more to deprive him of the hearts
of the people.
   In the course of human conduct it is found much easier to deviate from the laws of wisdom and virtue, than to leave the crooked paths, of vice, and regain that strict yet narrow road which leads to the temple of honour and happiness. Vice is, indeed, a labyrinth from which few can make their escape, and one bad action forms a kind of a necessity for a repetition, which few men have the courage and fortitude to withstand. Barillon had received strict commands from Lewis, to act in concert with the duke of York; in order to keep Charles steady to his engagements, and the infamous treaties which this monarch had made with the court of France, with that absolute power which the duke, on the knowledge of these intrigues, had acquired over him, formed insuperable obstacles to the adopting such a system of conduct, as should place the king above the reach of his domestic enemies, and emancipate him from those foreign fetters which had degraded him in the eyes of all the states of Europe. To preserve the king from ever being under a necessity of calling a parliament, a resolution was taken to send lord Dartmouth, with a squadron of men of war, to Tangier, to blow up the works, and to bring home the garrison; a measure which saved a considerable expence to the revenue, and gained a considerable accession to the standing forces of the crown; and if the total destruction of a place which had cost England such considerable sums of
money, was not sufficient to give the people a clear idea of the insincerity of the king's declaration on the subject of parliaments, they had matter for a full conviction on this particular, in the ensuing conduct of the court. All manner of prosecutions against the messengers, and other servants of the late house of commons, were manifestly encouraged; and even Williams, their speaker, was sued to the utmost extremity for the votes he had signed, and the warrants he
had issued in obedience to the orders of the house. As a farther encroachment on the privileges of parliament, Danby and the popish lords, who had been confined to the Tower by the authority of both houses, were admitted to bail; and, in defiance of an act which had passed every branch of the legislature, the commission for the admiralty was dissolved, and the duke of York was restored to his place at the council-board, re-invested with the title of lord high-admiral, and with all the powers and profits belonging to that employment.
   Whilst the king and his brother were thus insulting over the whole people of England, by the contempt they shewed for the authority of their representatives, and the dictates of law, the meanest subjection and most implicit obedience to the humour of the court of France is to be traced in
every part of their conduct. The duke of York excused the admitting lord Danby to bail, on the plea, that such a measure would give the king of France a still greater security, that no parliament would be called; and when a marriage between the princess Anne, the youngest daughter of the duke, and prince George of Denmark was in agitation, his royal highness assured the French minister, that no resolution should be taken on this subject till it was known
that it would be agreeable to Lewis; a circumstance which, with other incidents of a similar nature, gives great authority to those observations of bishop Burnet, wherein he differs from his cotemporary historians, who almost all represent the marriage of the princess Anne as an act of the
king, against the inclination, design, and interest of his royal highness. The party, according to custom, did not fail to make the most of this act of seeming popularity in the king, and continued their infamous subserviency to the
humours and vengeance of the court, in every vexatious prosecution against the lives and fortunes of those individuals, who were provoked to utter any complaints on the iniquity of public measures.
   The lenient hand of death had rescued Dubois from the persecutions of party; but Papillon was now brought to account, for the pretended insults offered to the magistracy of London by the arrest of the lord mayor. In the
course of the trial, Cornish, who appeared in behalf of the defendant, was attacked in the following scurrilous manner, by Jeffries, "I ask questions, says he to the Jury, to let the world see what fort of men these are who set up for saintship. You see we can hardly get one word of truth out of them: neither Bethel, nor that fellow Cornish, would take the oaths and sacrament according to law, till they found it would contribute to their design of subverting the government; then these rascals could qualify themselves for an office, only to put the kingdom in a flame." The knowledge which the reader must have obtained of the conduct and temper of juries, will guard him from that surprize which would otherwise undoubtedly have arisen in his mind on
their acquiescence to insults, which must have excited a high indignation in any civilized court of judicature.  They continued to fine and imprison, without the smallest hesitation or remorse, every man brought before them on any
pretence whatsoever, either for speaking what the lawyers termed scandalous and seditious words, or for any petitions in behalf of their invaded rights, but which in the style of the times were presented under the appellation of scandalous and seditious papers; and so forcible was the habit of bringing in a verdict against the subject, for any supposed offences committed against the government, and with , such a senseless degree of hardened injustice were the hearts of juries steeled, that in the following cafe of Rosewell, a dissenting minister, accused by three female adventurers for having preached treason in the pulpit, they abashed even the brazen front of Jeffries, and made the government blush for a partiality which too fully exposed the iniquitous depravity which had so strongly prevailed over justice and humanity in all these mock trials, which had proved fatal to the few individuals who had still preserved, through the corruptions of the times, a disinterested love for their country. Rosewell, in the course of his defence, proved that the witnefles were lewd and infamous persons; and in his own justification, that during all the late troubles he had preserved his loyalty; that he had prayed constantly for the king in his family prayers; and that in his sermons, he had often inculcated the obligation to obedience. Several witnesses deposed, that no such expressions had been used by the defendant, as had been sworn by the witnesses; his own notes were produced as a farther proof; and it was also
urged, that it was next to impossible for three women to remember so long a period upon one single hearing; and to remember it so exactly, as to agree to a tittle in their depositions. With regard to the matter of offence, the prisoner
offered to put the whole upon the following issue, that he would pronounce, with his usual tone of voice, a period as long as that which had been sworn against him; and he would give up his defence, if they could repeat it. This
method of proving their integrity was not embraced by the women, and what was yet more convincing, they could not mew, by any circumstance or witness, that they had been at the meeting; they had forgot even the text of the sermon, nor did they remember a single passage, but the words which they had deposed. The solicitor-general, confounded with the strength of the defence, did not think proper to make any reply; Jeffries went no farther than some general declamations against presbyterians and conventicles, which he called the nurseries of Rebellion; yet the jury, in defiance both of shame and conscience, brought the prisoner in guilty of treason. When Rosewell was brought up to receive sentence of death, he alledged, that there was not sufficient matter even in the indictment itself to justify the verdict which had been given against him ; and his counsel, Pollexfen and Wallop, argued the case for three days so strenuously, and to such purpose, that the lord chief justice and his two assistants, Withins and Walcot, found themselves under a necessity of declaring the judgment to be erroneous: but neither this extorted act of justice, nor the common law of the court, was sufficient to act in favour of the prisoner, till he had received the king's most gracious pardon; a circumstance of insult which the party did not fail to improve into a high act of merit, and which naturally will recall to the remembrance of the reader, that not a single individual had received mercy, where even the shadow of a pretence had authorised the sentence of death to be passed upon them.
   A natural timidity of temper, or a high degree of prudence, had so properly tempered the heat of party in Dr. Burner, the famous author of the history of these times, that the court had found no opportunity to make him feel the weight of that resentment which his principles had excited; he had so wisely checked the strong incentive of a natural curiosity, as to refuse the receiving that intelligence which his friends, who were engaged in the plot, would very freely have communicated. I will hear nothing, says he, that I may possibly be constrained to reveal. His prudence, however, could not entirely save him from every degree of persecution: his friend and patron, Sir Harbottle Grimston, had continued him in his office, as preacher of the Rolls Ghapel, and at this particular crisis, when the fears of popery were general among the zealous protestants, insisted on his preaching on an occasion no less important than the anniversary of the fifth of November. It must be acknowledged, that the occasion was critical; and that it was impossible to avoid the giving offence, without temporising in a manner totally unworthy the character of an honest man. Burnet chose the first as the least evil, his text was, "Save me from the lions mouth, preserve me from the horns of the unicorn;" and in the course of his sermon, he took occasion to mention a
kind of curse which had been uttered by king James the First against any of his posterity who should endeavour to bring in popery into England. In all probability, this was the most offensive part of the discourse; however, the court thought proper to fix it on the text, which the reverend preacher tells us was chosen by him in the simplicity of his heart, without once reflecting, that the lion and the unicorn were the two supporters of his majesty's arms. The
question of a prosecution was agitated, the lawyers were consulted, and being divided in their opinion, there was nothing more done in the business than to oblige Sir Harbottle Grimstone to dismiss the preacher, who thought it safest in the present height of monarchical power to leave the kingdom. So strong indeed was the tide against all those who did not farther the designs of the court, that Ward, bishop of Sarum, not being found so tractable as his brethren, on the pretence that a grant he had obtained of the king of the surplus revenues of the Garter, was deficient in point of form, was obliged to relinquish the grants, and all the profits he had received for it, for the space of several years: a method of punishment which answered the double purpose of revenge and supply, the latter of which was often effected by means yet more dishonourable, such as in the cafe of a young gentleman of a rich family, not supposed to be well affected to the court, who, in a quarrel which arose at a public supper, had unfortunately killed a man. As there were several people engaged in the fray, it was not certain by whom the man was killed, nor could the proofs carry it beyond man-slaughter; yet the young gentleman was, on the promise of a pardon, prevailed with to confess the indictment, and to let sentence pass on him for murder; and when he had thus thrown himself into the power of the court, his family were obliged to purchase the promised pardon at the expence of sixteen thousand pounds, which was equally divided between the king and his mistresses. It was not, however, only within the circle of the court that oppression was allowed to triumph; the dæmons of revenge and avarice had taken possession of the whole party, and were equally gratified by those monsters in the shape of men, who, in the office of juries, had perverted the wife and benign regulations of Alfred into an intolerable mode of tyranny. The duke of Beaufort, the earl of Peterborough, and several others, obtained enormous damages for some offensive words, which had been spoken in the heat of party; and with such vehemence was the
prosecutions carried on against the dissenters, that they were not only proceeded against for going to conventicles, but for not going to church, and for not receiving the sacrament; and those individuals among the sectaries, whose consciences would not suffer them to comply with the demands
of power, were excommunicated, and ruined by excessive fines.
   Whilst the junto in power were thus gratifying their ambition at the expence of the king's adversaries, they were not totally free from the effects of those malignant passions which fell with such weight on the Whig faction. The marquis of Hallifax, whose ambition had been solely fixed on the object of directing the royal counsels, had in vain endeavoured to maintain his influence in the cabinet by a removal of the duke's creatures and favourites: he had been so successful in finding out some malversations committed by
Laurence Hyde, earl of Rochester, in the course of the treasury business, as to prevent this aspiring nobleman, notwithstanding the high favour he stood in with the duke, from reviving in his person the office of lord treasurer. However, the earl of Rochester had been too deep in the secrets of the cabinet to be discarded; and the king, who found it necessary to preserve some balance against the almost absolute power of the duke, endeavoured to satisfy both parties at the expence of two of his servants, who had sacrificed both reputation and conscience to the humours of the court. Sir Lionel Jenkyns was prevailed on to quit, for a valuable consideration, his office of secretary of state to Godolphin, who was of the Rochester faction; and the earl of Radnor was
removed, to make room for the earl of Rochester at the head of the council board.
    In this acme of Power, the old project of changing the religion of the country was seriously resumed by the king, and pushed on with an eagerness peculiar to the warmth of his temper, by the duke. It was proposed by Jeffries in the cabinet, that a general jail delivery should be made of all the recusants, whom the rigour of the laws had deprived of their liberty; but the chancellor North, who regarded the proposal as a trap to bring him either into disgrace with the
church faction, or to undermine his favour at court, had the dexterity to ward off the blow, by representing, that the protestant sectaries, with whom the prisons were crowded, would, by such a conduct, receive an advantage only intended for the papists; an inconvenience which his majesty might easily avoid by extending the favour of his particular pardon to all those papists whom he might think proper to indulge and encourage.
   Laws enacted under a system of government so complicated as is that of the English monarchy, must necessarily partake of contradiction and obscurity, must necessarily become a burthen to the subject, and often entrap him, under a false idea of protection, into a pit of inevitable destruction. That system of oppression which the prerogative lawyers of these days termed strictly legal, had been in a great measure planned and conducted by Sir Francis North; who, for these services, was promoted, through all the steps of the law, to
the office of chancellor, with the dignity of a peerage. He had, however, now the mortification of seeing his more forward and adventurous rival Jeffries preferred to a higher degree of royal favour and confidence: we are told also, that he had melancholy apprehensions concerning the extreme abuse of that power which he had so highly contributed to establish in the crown ; but such is the strength of prejudice, when it is in any manner connected with personal interest, that we do not find he regretted the capital part he had himself acted in the factious conduct of the times.
   The loyal duke of Ormond, by the large military establishment he had fixed on the Irish, and other regulations favourable to despotic power, had rendered that nation entirely subservient to the will of the crown. It was among the boasted virtues of this nobleman's administration, that Ireland was not only preserved in a perfect state of obedience, but the king had a large army at command, ready to transport to any part of his dominions, where the mutinous spirit of the people should appear against the fashionable doctrines of passive obedience and non-resistance; and it was on these grounds that Ireland was thought the proper stage to begin that hopeful reformation, which was intended in the religion of the empire. But though the duke of Ormond
had effectually paved the way for this event, yet, on account of his prejudices to the church of England, and his station as head of that party, he was not thought a proper person to complete the work, and a flimsey pretext was
found to remove him, at a time when he thought himself secure, on account of his recent disgraceful services in England, of enjoying for the remainder of his days those inestimable fruits which are preferred by courtiers to the less
glittering yet solid honours which attend the dignity of patriotic virtue.
   Of all the candidates for royal confidence, the earl of Sunderland was the most especially trusted by the king and his brother, both on account of his connexion with the duchess of Portsmouth, and the pliancy of his disposition.
The earl of Sunderland had been a party in all the French treaties, and was the secret spring of all the politics of the cabinet. A patriot from inclination, and a courtier from interest, he had opposed the duke's elevation to the crown, as
long as he found such a conduct in any degree suitable to his personal safety, or the interests of his fortune; but, when by the sudden turn of popular opinion, and the obstinacy with which the king supported his brother's schemes and pretensions, he found no probable hope of any alteration in the system of administration, he changed his politics with the occasion, and determined to secure a personal favour, by rendering his talents subservient to the intentions of a government which he could not circumvent. The earl
of Sunderland was early acquainted with the project which had been formed of re-establishing the popish religion in England; a measure which, in the beginning of the reign, appeared too full of difficulty and danger to be imparted even to Buckingham and Lauderdale, but had now, by that universal servility, which was become the boast of all ranks and professions of men, lost its terrors; and, indeed, what could a minister have to fear, when every position to limit the omnipotence of kings, either by the rules of the constitution, or the dictates of the law, had been repeatedly declared, both by the clergy and the laity, to be traiterous and irreligious.
   We are told by Burnet, that the removal of the duke of Ormond from the lieutenancy of Ireland was advised by lord Sunderland, who farther proposed the division of the civil and military power; and that the one should be entrusted to the earl of Rochester, and the other should be put into such hands as could be most religiously confided in, for the execution of the grand design. Agreeable to this plan of policy, the duke of Ormond, whose presence was no longer necessary in England, was dispatched in all haste back to his government, where he had not continued a month, when he received advice from his friend, Sir Robert Southwell, that his removal was absolutely resolved on; and in less than a month, the advice was confirmed by a letter from the king's own hand, by whom he had very lately been cajoled with the promise of holding the lieutenancy for life. Though, the- duke, trusting to appearances, had flattered himself that he had lest fewer enemies behind him at court than on any other occasion, yet he bore the disappointment with his usual serenity, and without any other reflections on the king's ingratitude and insincerity than what are to be found in a letter to his son, the earl of Arran: "In the time of the popish plot, my defects and failings, says he, were courted ; but now they are conspicuous and mustered up: my age, my sloth, my aversion to the Roman catholics, and my negligence in the choice of such as I have recommended to, or placed in the king's service."
   That mere externals, however specious their appearances, are not of sufficient weight in the scale of human happiness to secure the internal enjoyment of the mind, has been the result of all moral speculation, from the earliest period of antiquity to the present time; and never was there an instance, in the annals of human nature, which afforded a more striking instance of the truth of this observation than the example which history sets forth in the person of Charles the Second. This prince, according to the idea of vulgar conception, was now arrived at the acme of human happiness; all those whom he regarded as his enemies, because the friends of the constitution, were prostrate at his feet; the laws were all subverted to the purposes of his power; the loud voice of faction had declared, that the despotism which he affected, was an unalienable and inseparable right annexed to the office of kingship; and all those blemishes in his government and vices in his private life which were justly the objects of aversion and contempt to the patriotic
and religious mind, was, by that universal flattery which ever attends unmerited success, complimented as perfections of the highest rank; and he enjoyed, with the worst of the Roman emperors, every species of human incense which fell short of deification.
   It is agreed by all parties, that the king, in the most flourishing state of the opposition, had never expressed so much uneasiness and dissatisfaction of mind as at this period of his exaltation. Various have been the opinions
formed on the cause of this extraordinary circumstance: some writers have imagined, that it proceeded from the power and insolence of the duke's faction, who treated the king as a mere cypher, whilst they looked up to the duke as a patron, who was, from temper and inclination, more disposed to afford them that firm and steady protection requisite for men who had set the laws at defiance, and among whom there were many who had entertained the most hostile designs, both against the religion and liberties of the country: others have imagined, that the dangerous attempts to which the imprudent warmth of the duke's temper was continually pushing the king, gave him apprehension and uneasiness, and he was overheard to fay one day, in opposing some of the duke's hasty counsels, "Brother, I am too old to travel
again; you may, if you please." Other writers again insist,  that the agitation of the king's mind arose from a return of affection for the disgraced and banished duke of Monmouth, and a recoil of conscience for the injuries he had done the
constitution, and the manner in which he had abused the power obtained over the Whig faction: but Dalrymple, who, by the p0ssession 0f the papers taken out of the Depot at Versailles, had a more extensive knowledge of facts than
the less modern writers, with much more probability ascribes the visible change in the king's temper to the stoppage of the payment of the French pension, which rendered it impossible for him to maintain the expences of his houshold and government without a parliament, an exigence attended with the most 'mortifying circumstance; as it lay in the power of the French monarch to embroil the king with his best friends, and to throw disgrace and ridicule on the whole faction, for the obstinacy with which they had always maintained that no such injurious treaties as had been insisted on by the patriots, had ever subsisted between Charles and the French court. It is certain, that Lewis and his ambassador regarded the king of England as absolutely in their power. Barillon frequently mentions the threat of making public the king's secret transactions, as a stroke of thunder proper to be made use of when all other means should fail; and Charles had lately been made acquainted with Lewis's intrigues with the popular party, and that the abbe Primi, who, during these intrigues, had published a history of the original treaty made at Dover, had been encouraged in this undertaking by royal authority, and was in the actual enjoyment of a pension from the court
of France. According to these facts it is not surprising, that Charles should be conscious of a difficulty in his situation, which he had never experienced at a period, when his affairs carried the most desperate appearance; however, the necessity of his circumstances, and the resentment with which he was inspired against his treacherous ally, determined him to run the hazard of a total change in the measures of his government. Monmouth was sent for, and introduced to the king in private; it was determined that the earl of Rochester should be disgraced; that a narrow inspection should be made into the frauds which had been committed in the treasury; that the duke of York should be sent to Scotland; that all the unpopular ministers should be dismissed; that
a parliament should be summoned; and that the king should fling himself entirely on the good-will of his subjects.
   These wholesome resolutions were either taken too late, or promulged too early for the peace of the kingdom, or the king's personal safety. On the pretence of holding a parliament in Scotland, Charles had signified to his brother his design offending him to that kingdom : the duke insisted, that
there was no occasion for the measure, on which the king hastily replied, "Brother, you must go, or I." This conversation was followed by a visible coldness and reserve on the part of the king: the duke's party took the alarm, preparations were making for his royal highness's sudden departure; Monday the second of February, was set to inspect the treasury books; a new and unusual concern was to be seen in the faces of those individuals of the popish party who were employed about the court, when the king's unexpected and
critical illness and death, so providentially turned the whole face of affairs as to involve those whose apparent interest was essentially concerned in the unexpected event, in the suspicion of being the criminal authors of their good
fortune.
