THE shameful desertion of the popular interest, and the entire abandoning of all sentiment and principle to motives of policy, had not secured to the marquis of Hallifax, the object of his ambition in the unrivalled possession of the king's favour and confidence. The duke of York maintained an absolute ascendency in the cabinet; and, by his influence, the earl of Sunderland, for whom, on account of a long rivalship, the marquis of Hallifax had a personal aversion, and Laurence Hyde, now created earl of Rochester, had arisen to a consequence in the king's counsels, altogether incompatible to the views and pretensions of Hallifax, who always affected to be considered as the sole
minister. The duke of Monmouth, who had been very serviceable to the marquis, in removing prejudices which the king had entertained in his disfavour, and who had been afterwards, on motives of policy, very injuriously treated by him, was now considered as the only ally by whose personal influence a balance could be formed in the cabinet, against the predominating power of the duke of York. The retreat of Monmouth, after long enquiry, was discovered by Hallifax, and a correspondence immediately took place, by which Monmouth was prevailed on to send a letter to the king, which had been previously penned by the marquis, and which was written in a strain of acknowledgement, submission, penitence, and promises of amendment, calculated to produce the intended effect. The king, either from motives of returning tenderness, or with the intention of rendering Monmouth instrumental in his farther design on the lives and credit of the popular party, consented to an interview, in which the duke of Monmouth was graciously received, and directed to write another letter in the same style as the former, but in which the duke of York's anger was to be mollified by personal compliments, and personal submissions. It was at length determined that Monmouth should surrender himself; and, in order to spare him the mortification of witnesses to those submissions which were required, he was left alone with the king and duke. What passed in this interview, it is impossible to ascertain, because the assertions of the two parties are totally opposite to each other; but the made so ungenerous a use of the concessions he had exacted from his son as to call an extraordinary council, to whom he declared, that the duke of Monmouth had shewn himself very sensible of his crime in the late conspiracy; had made a full declaration of it; had expressed an extraordinary penitence; had made a particular submission to his royal highness; and that, at his royal highness's desire and intreaty, he had granted him his pardon.
   This mortifying declaration was rendered yet more public through the medium of the Gazette: the proscribed party took the alarm; shame and indignation filled the breast of Monmouth. He had been promised that nothing should be required of him but what was safe and honourable; he had
been told that the demanded submissions were only to please and blind the duke of York; he had been exempted from the ignominy of becoming an evidence against his partizans; and he had been flattered from the manner in which his submissions and confession had been taken, that no other use was to be made of them, than to effectuate a reconciliation with the duke of York. To these provocations the king declared, that Monmouth had confirmed all which Howard had sworn: Monmouth denied that he had said any such thing, and added that lord Howard was a liar and a rogue. To prevent the advantages which the party might receive from this counter-declaration of Monmouth, it was published in the next Gazette, that the king had pardoned him on his confessing the plot. The marquis again interposed as a mediator: he pressed Monmouth to pass over these affronts, and to impute it to the importunity of his enemies, and the king's easiness; he represented that the last day of the term drew near, in which all the prisoners were to be discharged, according to the act of Habeas Corpus; that such discharge would manifest that he had discovered nothing to their prejudice; and consequently that all discourses concerning his confession and discoveries would vanish in a few days.
Monmouth was far from being convinced by the power of these arguments; but he had the prudence to conceal his resentment, till his pardon was passed, after which he publicly denied that he had confessed one tittle of the pretended plot. This conduct of Monmouth not only defeated the purposes of the court, in regard to the lives of the prisoners; but exposed the mean arts of the cabinet, and rendered the plot yet more problematical than it had hitherto been considered by the public. A council was called, to debate on this untoward circumstance, in which the duke of Ormond proposed that the duke of Monmouth should be directed to put something in writing, which might stand as a witness on record, against his future contradictions. On this occasion, the marquis of Hallifax gave his pupil many instructions on the subject of those refinements in conduct, which had been so prejudicial to his own virtue and reputation, and which the cunning man is so apt to consider as marks of a superior understanding; but which will be always found defective of those happy consequences, which must ever attend plain dealing, plain honesty, and plain sense. He importuned him to write a letter to the king, acknowledging that he had confessed the plot; plot he said Was a general word, which might signify as little as a man pleased: there certainly had been
dangerous consultations, which might be properly called plots, and the service which he might do his friends by such a general letter, and by gaining the king's heart upon it, would quickly balance the seeming prejudice which such a general acknowledgment would bring them under, and which could do them no hurt. By such arguments as these, and perhaps more by the importunities of his wife, who held a high place fn the duke of York's favour, Monmouth was prevailed on to send a paper to the king, which, on the first perusal, gave
satisfaction to his Majesty; but when it came to be debated in Council, objections were started by the duke of Ormonde.  The letter, he said, was rather a justification of the plot than otherwise; and the king was told that it was a great affront to his understanding, to attempt to impose on him in such a manner, for there was no plain confession of any conspiracy, and the man who drew it up had wit enough to know that it was ineffectual, and would do more harm than good. On these objections of the duke of Ormond, the paper, which is supposed to have been drawn by the marquis of Hallifax, was
materially corrected with the king's own hand: it acknowledged in plain and direct terms, that Monmouth had confessed the conspiracy, and that the persons who had suffered, had been condemned with justice. Monmouth, on seeing the paper, made his exceptions; but at length was prevailed on by the king, and by assurances that it should never be produced against Hampden, to copy the corrected paper and sign it.
   Monmouth had no sooner been guilty of this weak act than all its dreadful arid shameful consequences appeared in their strongest colours: he recollected that Hampden's present situation was similar to that in which Sidney had suffered; and that a paper of much less consequence than the paper he had just signed, had been used as an instrument to his destruction.
He considered himself as standing in the same light to the public and to his party, as that infamous nobleman the lord Howard; and stung with the reproaches of his friends, and the keen feelings of self-condemnation, he ran in an agony of passion to the king, and in a manner extorted from him the paper, which was to have held him out to the world as one of the meanest as well as the wickedest of men. Among the expostulations which passed between the father and the son, on this very interesting subject, the king told Monmouth, that if he did not yield in this point, he would ruin him; but Monmouth still persisting with an increasing warmth in his importunities, the king yielded the point, but in terms of such displeasure, as to call his son a blockhead, a beast, and a dishonest fellow. Monmouth was immediately
dismissed the court, a copy of the letter was entered on the council books, and, contrary to the king's solemn promise, a subp≈ìna was issued, to force him to give his testimony at the trial of Hampden. Monmouth, rather than appear as an evidence against his friend, fled the country; and retired to Flanders, where he was highly caressed by the marquis of Grana, the governor of the Spanish Netherlands. He soon after removed to Holland; and, notwithstanding all the duke of York's remonstrances to his son-in-law, he was well received, and continued to be kindly treated by the prince of Orange; and from this period, the States of the United Provinces became an asylum for all the English refugees, whose conduct in any respect had subjected them to the rage of the domineering faction in England.
   That Hampden might not escape the vengeance of the court, on the flight of the duke of Monmouth, the manner of the indictment for high treason, in compassing the king's death, was changed into an indictment for a misdemeanor, in consulting to raise a rebellion; and tho' it is contrary to
the whole tenor of the law, to set forth the same offence under two several descriptions, and consequently Mr. Hampden was either legally innocent, or legally guilty of treason, yet the attorney-general had the assurance to allege that the king had chosen this milder way of proceeding, that the defendant might have all opportunities to clear his innocence, by the assistance of council, and the admitting his witnesses to give in their depositions upon oath, and also in order to silence the clamours of the faction, who had accused the government of laying his accomplices under great hardships, for the want of these advantages. The detail of lord Howard's evidence, was in general the fame as that which had been delivered against Russel and Sidney; only it is worth notice, that lord Howard, who had now, in all probability, obtained his pardon, and consequently was no longer under the influence of fear, could not recollect one word of those two long speeches of Hampden's, which he had narrated in his evidence, against his friend and patron Sidney, although his memory had been refreshed by the perusal of a copy of his original informations, which had been delivered him out of the paper-office. The chief justice, who had boasted, that no man in his office had ever rendered unto any king of England such services as he had done, in making it to pass  for law, that the subjects may be tried by a jury, not consisting of freemen, and that one witness, with any concurrent circumstance, such as the purchase of a knife, is sufficient to convict any man of treason, was determined not to suffer his high reputation to be in any degree diminished by the escape of Hampden, and consequently his behaviour was equally violent, equally irregular, and equally brutal, to that in which he had in so singular a manner distinguished
himself at the trial of Sidney. Accordingly, when the council for the defendant would have produced a witness, to depose that the earl of Essex had so mean an opinion of lord Howard, that it was not likely he should ever mix with him in consultations of so delicate a nature, as those which had been deposed to the court, the chief justice, not only refused to admit the evidence of a third person, but most savagely added, that it seemed the earl had such an opinion
of lord Howard's evidence, that he cut his throat upon it; and, in his charge to the jury, he exhorted them to bring the defendant in guilty, otherwise they would discredit all they had done before. The jury, without hesitation, followed the directions of the bench, and the court set a fine on the defendant of forty thousand pounds damages, though but fifteen thousand pounds bail had been demanded for the treason. Hampden was committed to prison, till the fine was paid, and till he should find sureties for his good behaviour during life.
   The same spirit of persevering cruelty, the same measure of illegal oppression, the same mean artifices, the same ensnaring conduct, the same laying in wait for blood, which were so conspicuous in the prosecutions of the first prisoners, were equally manifest through the whole course of the proceedings of the government, and the conduct of the courts of law, against every individual who had been charged with having a part in the conspiracy. Halloway was a merchant of Bristol, who had engaged in a design of establishing a linen manufactory in England, and had proceeded in it with
some success. He was afterwards obliged to desist from the undertaking, by the connivance of the English government to the importation of French linens; and it was in the course of his solicitations for an act of parliament to support him in this new branch of manufactory, that he entered into the society of patriots, and was prevailed on to become an adventurer for the liberties of his country. He had been twice taken after Keiling's discovery, and had twice made his escape, an outlawry was issued against him, after which he was seized in the West Indies, by the treachery of his factor, and was, by Sir William Stapleton, remitted a prisoner to England. This unhappy man was induced to seek mercy, by a voluntary confession of all he knew: he acknowledged that he had heard of a project for a rising in the year 1682;
he acknowledged that three persons had undertaken to dispose Bristol to a revolt; he declared he had an intimation of the assassination from West and Rumsey; and he signified that the general design of an insurrection, after the flight of the earl of Shaftesbury, had fallen under a new direction, viz.
of the earl of Essex: but as the first project for the rising, according to the confession of the prisoner, had been mere matter of talk, for the space of nine months; as the assassination had only been mentioned by West and Rumsey, who named only the two Rumbolds and Goodenough, as associates; as the general design under the new direction, hung so long in suspence, that those who waited for the word of command, thought it absolutely necessary to undertake for themselves; as Bristol had been so little taken care of, that
not above three persons had undertaken to dispose the inhabitants to a rising, the whole amount of the confession fell so short of the pompous accounts, set forth in print by royal authority, and declared by the judges from the bench, that the court affected to consider it as an insincere one; and, as the prisoner had too little invention, too small a proportion of fear, or too much honesty, to set forth such a luxuriant narration as lord Howard, the court determined he should die, in order to justify former proceedings; and to shew that they were yet of opinion, that a most damnable, dangerous, and hellish conspiracy, had hung over the kingdom, and had only been prevented from taking effect, to the ruin or massacre of all loyal subjects, by the special interposition of divine
Providence.
   The treachery of law in the courts of justice, has been one of the most fruitful sources of our historical observations, through the whole reign of Charles the Second; but surely the most solemn farce that ever disgraced the name of mercy, was exhibited in the King's Bench, on the subject of this unfortunate merchant. On his being brought into court, he was told by the chief justice, that nothing remained but to make a rule for his execution; but then the attorney-general gave him to understand, that, as a matter of grace, the king
was willing to wave his outlawry, and admit him to a trial. On this insult the prisoner was surprised into a declaration, that he could not undertake to defend himself, for he had confessed, before his majesty, many things contained in the indictment; and he therefore threw himself on the king's
mercy. On this justice Withins called on the assembly, to take notice of the prisoner's open confession; and added, surely there are none but will believe this conspiracy, after what this man has owned: and the lord chief justice, not
to be wanting in his share of the interlude, observed, that whereas, Sir Samuel Bernardiston had in his letters called the plot, a sham plot, and said it was lost, unless it was to be found among the abhorrers and addressers, he might now let his correspondents know, that it was to be found among, the reformers of government and religion; who could swallow all things, could kill kings, levy war, and do the worst of villanies, to promote religion and reformation. After
these unfair advantages had been taken, to blacken and misrepresent the persecuted party, the scene closed with the appointing the day for the prisoner's execution ; who, according to his own account, was yet flattered, till the arrival of the fatal period, with the hopes of the king's mercy, in the intention of getting as much out of him as was possible, or rather extorting, through the influence of fear and hope, a confession more agreeable to those representations which had been set forth by authority. However, the prisoner
continued, to the last, to adhere firmly to the relation which he had frankly given to the court; he professed at the place of execution, that he had made all the discoveries in his power; he solemnly affirmed, that the plot he was acquainted with, was not against the king's life, but only to secure those who were guilty of the popish plot, and who were enemies to the privileges and liberties of the subject. He observed the partiality which was evident in managing this plot, different from what had appeared in managing the popish plot; and that the same men who were called rogues, when they swore against papists, were looked on as honest men when they swore against protestants. He intimated, that those apprehensions of popery and arbitrary power, which had actuated the conspirators in their consultations, were not without grounds; and, in all his answers to the sheriffs, who harrassed him with many ensnaring questions, he answered them with a propriety and temper, which manifested his constancy of mind, and did honour to his abilities. He underwent the sentence of the law with a decency and composure becoming the part he had acted in the preparatory scene; and, in his last speech, which was published after his death, he expressed a very deep sense of religion. 
   SiR Thomas Armstrong was among the list of outlaws. He had fled for sanctuary to Leyden; but, by the means of a bribe of five thousand gilders to the bailiff of the town, and a fatal omission, in claiming the rights of nativity, for Armstrong was born at Nimeguen, he was put into the hands of Chudleigh, the English envoy, and sent to London. From a more than common dejection of mind, which the prisoner had shewn, whilst he was managing his escape
from England, and from his having led a remarkably vicious life, for he had been admitted to the first rank among the king's boon companions, it was hoped, that he would make important discoveries: but, to the great disappointment of the state politicians, when he was examined before the council, he said, he knew of no plot, but the popish plot; and only desired that he might have a fair trial for his life. This, it is to have been imagined, would, on motives of policy, have been granted, if the evidence against lord Russel had, in the opinion of the court, been so strong and full as they thought
proper to represent it; for Armstrong was said to have been one of the persons who had undertaken to view the guards; and Rumsey and lord Howard had gone far in their endeavours, to make him a principal in the scheme of assassination: but even in the present state of juries, it was not thought adviseable to repeat those experiments on the laws, which must put every thinking man in mind of the destruction they had made in personal security; and that trial, which was granted to Halloway, because his own confession was a sufficient evidence against him, was refused to Armstrong, because no such evidence had been procured. And though a statute of the sixth of Edward the Sixth, is express, that if an outlaw comes in within the year, he is to have a trial, notwithstanding his outlawry, the chief justice Jeffries, with his usual effrontery, denied the prisoner's claim, on the pretence, that the statute extended to those who came in on their own accord. However, being aware that the seizure of the person, must in equity be supposed the accident which
prevented him from coming in , and that the law makes no such distinction, because, were it allowed, the proviso might be frustrated at the instant the party was proceeding to qualify himself as directed; he, with a yet higher degree of brazen injustice, denied the prisoner's demand of counsel; alledging, there was no need of counsel in so clear a case: and when Armstrong insisted that the statute was plain, he replied with his usual savage insolence, so it is very plain that you can have no advantage from it. The prisoner now referred to the offer which had been lately made to Halloway; adding, that his case was quite different, being certain of his innocence: he was answered, that the offer made to Halloway was the grace and mercy of the king; but that, according to law, the execution must be awarded upon the outlawry. In the midst of this dialogue an incident happened, which affected every breast not steeled by a constitutional insensibility, by interest, or party malice: a daughter of the prisoner, who was present in court, overcome with a sense of her father's danger, and irritated with the apparent injustice, by which she was to be deprived of paternal protection, broke out into these passionate expressions: "My lord, I hope you will not murder my father, this is murdering a man." And, when the chief justice, with a passion unbecoming any other man, ordered her to be committed; she, with, an accent which spoke the agonies of her soul, exclaimed, "God Almighty's vengeance light on you." The prisoner had now the mortification to see his beloved and afflicted daughter carried off by the marshal, whilst Jeffries took occasion to declare on the ruffle this affecting incident had occasioned, that he thanked God that he was clamour-proof. The attorney-general, to take off from the minds of the assembly
those impressions which an indecorum arising from filial piety, rendered frantic by despair and injury, had occasioned, began to inveigh against the prisoner, as a man who deserved not that indulgence and mercy which had been shewn to Halloway; for, he said, there was full and clear evidence that he was one of those who had actually undertaken, on the king's hasty return to New-market, to cut him off by the way; and that besides, when he was taken beyond sea, letters of communication with foreign ministers and others,
were found upon him. The attorney-general was running on in this manner, when he was stopped by the more crafty Jeffries, who undoubtedly recollected, that these circumstances, if true, were arguments for a trial in order to produce legal proof; he therefore intimated that the outlawry, and
not the evidence, was now before the court; and he recurred to his first decision, that yielding upon force was not yielding upon the statute. On the prisoner's representing to the court, that the lords of the council had allowed him to have the advice of counsel, but that the order had been of no use, for having been robbed of all the money he possessed, by those who took him, it was not in his power to see a lawyer, a very smart dialogue ensued, in which Sir Thomas Armstrong asserted, that he ought to have the benefit of the law, and he desired no more; and which concluded in the following manner, by the chief justice, "That you shall have, by the grace of God; I will fee that execution shall be done on Friday next, according to law; you shall have the full benefit of the law.''
   That divine mercy, which often produces from an apparent evil the brightest and the happiest consequences, never was more conspicuous than in the change which the exigence of this occasion, wrought in the manners, temper, and principles of Sir Thomas Armstrong. From the first period of his imprisonment, to the fatal moment which terminated his existence, his carriage excited the admiration, and surprised every one who had been acquainted with him in the former parts of his life: he rejoiced that he was brought to give this fad and solemn testimony of his political principles ; and said, that it would have been scarce possible for him to have been converted to a due sense of his former errors, by any visitation less severe than the sufferings of a violent death. "His pride and his resentments, says Burner, were entirely subdued; he received the sacrament, and died in so good a temper, and in so much quiet in his mind, and so serene a deportment, that we have scarce known in our time, a more eminent instance of the grace and mercy of God." 
   We have before had occasion to observe, that the malignity of human malice, though accompanied with a power equal to the effecting the most atrocious acts of cruelty, is often defeated of its revengeful purposes, by the benign
interposition of Providence; and this by a sudden revolution in the disposition of the mind, by which it is brought to acquiesce with circumstances of rigor, which, in a more ordinary state of its powers, could not have been reflected
on without horror. Never did any proceedings partake of a more severe spirit of revenge and cruelty than those which signalized the conduct of the court, in the prosecution of Sir Thomas Armstrong. Contrary to the custom used to prisoners of his rank, and who had served in such high posts under the government, he was loaded with irons. From the first period of his being taken into custody, he had but six days allowed him to prepare for death; he was drawn on a sledge from Newgate to Tyburn, surrounded with a numerous detachment of those guards he had once commanded; and every particular of the barbarous and inhuman punishment, which the laws prescribe for treason, was executed,upon; him with the utmost rigor: his bowels were taken out and burnt; his body was divided, and its different quarters hung up, as a terror to all those who should venture to oppose the measures of government. As an excuse for the cruel indignities inflicted on a man, who had been a sharer in the king's familiar hours, his majesty asserted to his courtiers, and to the foreign ministers, that Armstrong had been sent over by Cromwell to murder him, whilst an exile. That his majesty was warned of it, and challenged
Armstrong upon it; and that upon his confessing it, he had promised never to speak of it any more, as long as the offender lived; but as he was now to be counted dead in 4aw, he regarded himself as absolved from the promise. In
the paper which was published after Sir Thomas's death, he so entirely confuted this improbable tale, and makes it appear so evident, that he suffered a close imprisonment, from the power of the usurper, for the service he had rendered his majesty, in carrying him over bills of Exchange, and letters of importance, from his friends in England , that the apologists of Charles, have thought proper to adopt another palliative for the king's conduct, in the oppressive and cruel treatment of the man who had shared his familiar hours, viz. that his majesty's resentment had been raised to an extraordinary height, on the supposition that Sir Thomas had been the man who had perverted from his filial duty and loyalty his beloved son, the duke of Monmouth: as if on the grounds, that the supposition was just, a spirit of malice and revenge, which are in themselves mean and criminal, can be admitted as extenuating circumstances for acts of the highest moral turpitude, viz. acts of injustice
and acts of oppression.
   The knowledge of any design against the king's life, as asserted in the infamous depositions of Howard and Rumsey, was absolutely denied by Sir Thomas in the paper which he delivered to the sheriffs ; and he asserts, that if he had been tried, he could have proved by the evidence of ten gentlemen, that lord Howard's reflections on him were a notorious falshood; and that he dined with this nobleman on the very day which, according to his deposition, he was
said to be on the road to Windsor in the design of waylaying the king. It is to be observed, that lord Howard's deposition is one of the palliative circumstances urged by bishop Spratt for the king's not going out of the way of
the law, as he says, to mew any distinguishing act of grace in favour of a man who had made so many un grateful returns for the personal obligations he had received from majesty.
   Though the scene of blood in England closed with the horrid execution of Sir Thomas Armstrong, it put no stop to the rigorous prosecutions which were carried on by the court against individuals who were supposed to be guilty
of much smaller trespasses. Joseph Hayes, an eminent citizen of London, was indicted for high-treason, for having traiterously relieved Sir Thomas Armstrong, by assigning, or paying for his use, one hundred and fifty pounds, contrary to the duty of his allegiance, &c. The indictment had no other support than hear-say evidence, and a similitude of hands, sworn to by one witness, and contradicted by another: however, Sir George Jeffries, who had received a
ring of value from the king, on the services he had rendered in this and the preceding trials, and which, from these circumstances, was nominated the blood-stone, with an unabated spirit kept up to the part he had hitherto acted, but with unequal success: he overuled three points of law, urged by the prisoner; and he endeavoured to give an undue influence to the jury, by representing him as a busy, factious citizen. Hayes' defence consisted in an
absolute denial of every tittle of the charge: he also observed, that the witnesses did not swear positively, but only according to their belief; that no two of them swore to the same point; that Chudleigh's secretary alone had sworn the letter was found in Sir Thomas's papers; and that Everies alone had sworn that. he had seen such a bill, but did not know the hand. He alledged, that overtures of life had been made to him on certain terms, and asked the jury whether they could think that he would have risked his life, if he might have secured it by telling the truth? "Gentlemen, adds he, I have declared to you the whole truth, with all the solemnity which becomes an innocent man, and you have heard the evidence; it is nothing but circumstance and hear-say; and shall a man's life be taken away, for I believe, I think, and I have heard? Gentlemen, you are my fellow-citizens and fellow-christians, of the same reformed religion; and I hope you are sworn into this service without any prejudice against me, but with an impartial resolution to do justice; therefore I leave the matter chearfully to you. I am sure, that if God help me, and deliver me in this exigence, it is you that, under him, must preserve my life. Gentlemen, the great uncertainties, improbabilities, and consequences in this case, I hope, will be weighed by you: we must all die; and I am sure that it will be no grief to you, when you come to the final period of mortality, that you have acquitted an innocent man." The chief justice, in his charge to the jury, employed all the powers of his rhetoric, to make the protestations of the prisoner pass for a strain of the same hypocrisy, which, according to him, was the distinguishing characteristic of the whole party. But though it is difficult to imagine on what English statute Hayes could have been indicted for high-treason, yet, in all probability, this spirited citizen owed his acquittal more to the having made thirty-five peremptory challenges of the jury, than to the deficiency in point of law or evidence, or to the courageous and pathetic address with which he had closed his defence; and, greatly to the disappointment of all parties, after a debate of two hours, the jury brought in their verdict, not guilty. But if the court was for once disappointed, by an unexpected tincture of honesty, in some of the individuals which formed this jury, they were equally gratified by the conduct of those who succeeded to this office.
